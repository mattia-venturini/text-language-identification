The Millennium Development Goals deadline falls within the duration of the first financing instrument for development cooperation.
The Azerbaijani Government is losing its credibility by breaching conventions it has itself signed up to, such as the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights.
On the issue of proportionality, whilst there have been some cases of minor importance for which a European Arrest Warrant was issued, it is ultimately a matter for the issuing authority in each Member State to decide for which offences it wants to launch the proceedings.
Subjugation to the choices and plans of the capitalist undertaking must be strengthened, while 'employability' and entry to the labour market via apprenticeship, mobility in sectors of the economy and so-called accessibility between levels of education and training must be facilitated.
This reports, and the others in the package, should have at least had the good sense to keep public investment separate from deficit calculations, in the name of job creation, which would be the main objective of any economic coordination that was mindful of Europeans' concerns.
It is very important for Croatia to join, but it is also important to remember that the Pope warned the Croats to beware of a bureaucratic, centralist structure.
It has always been updated with two main goals in mind guaranteeing an income for European farmers and dealing with an ever-decreasing EU budget, while not forgetting a whole host of other objectives linked to quality of production, of the environment, of biodiversity and of water resources.
If we are talking about European integration or the future of these programmes and projects which we have in mind here, all these young people must feel European.
We grant the working group the freedom to submit any necessary recommendations.
The European SME Week in October will be a good opportunity to work together to raise awareness of SME policy and the needs of SMEs everywhere in the European Union.
Implementation of excessive deficit procedure 
Europe is a community of freedom, responsibilities and democratic values.
I welcome the efforts that have been made towards clarifying Union law in order to make it more accessible to all EU citizens. I am therefore voting for this proposal for a directive on protection structures for narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors. I believe that the proposed system of codification drafted using a data processing system is more efficient.
The speakers in this Parliament should not run the risk of having their speech wrecked by interruptions from the Chair on behalf of the interpreters.
It is my credo, and that of the Hungarian Presidency as well, that we have to base all our steps on trust - and I would even say mutual trust -, on taking responsibility and on solidarity, just like you have urged us. Whether it be about economic policy, Schengen reforms, asylum or enlargement, this is what we must build on. The solution - as proposed by the great majority - is more Europe, a stronger Europe; the Hungarian Presidency has been working for the last six months with this in mind.
The financial crisis has highlighted that there are three key problems in the industry lack of competition, over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework and no liability for ratings by CRAs.
The idea of a transnational list is absurd. I have several questions Why would Slovak, German or Italian electors vote for people they cannot understand without an interpreter How will their elected MEPs then represent them if they cannot even read letters sent to them by their constituents How many times is a Greek MEP going to meet his Slovak voters What are they going to discuss Besides, only large Member States will benefit from a pan-European list.
Drawing up a new MFF as set out in this report will help devise a long-term action plan which will produce definite results and offer the potential to ensure economic growth for the EU.
The oft-used phrase 'an economic giant but a political dwarf' takes on new meaning when we analyse the EU's presence in international organisations and in other regional organisations of which it is part.
When any member of the public contacts me in my constituency, I simply say to them to write back to the company and tell it to send all future correspondence to me. They never hear another thing.
In the short term, implementation of a mechanism to compensate the European farmers most affected must be guaranteed, while in the medium term, it will be necessary to reform the early warning system for unsafe food to prevent any more unfounded alarms in the future.
The activity of interest representatives from a variety of areas in relation to Union institutions - in this instance, Parliament and the Commission - has undeniable advantages.
With the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, pursuant to Articles 206 and 207 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU, foreign direct investment becomes the exclusive competence of the European Union.
As such, I call on all those involved in the trialogues to properly weigh up the need to protect legitimate expectations and the correct application of the Treaty of Lisbon, paying particular attention to the articles relating to the re-examination and withdrawal of authorisation.
The Commission is working hand in hand with the Member States with one common goal to bring this outbreak to an end as soon as possible. I am insisting to all concerned that, in situations like this, it is not a local problem, it is a European problem.
Thank you very much also for your ongoing support for European regional policy and for its development.
third I am pleased to see your determination with regard to Camp Ashraf; our voice in opposition to violence against civilians must be clear and decisive there and everywhere else in the world.
Many were injured.
I voted in favour of the report on international air agreements under the Treaty of Lisbon, as it highlights the importance of Parliament being 'immediately and fully informed at all stages' of the process of negotiating agreements between the EU and third countries or international organisations.
Its essential point is a request for an increase of at least 5 in the total EU budget for 2013, and the request for the introduction of an autonomous source of funding.
You can count on the support of this Parliament, and not only its support, in fact, but also its mandate to establish a rational, structured and coherent representation of the European Union on the international stage as soon as possible.
On the basis of this agreement with the regions and with the Member States, a budget totalling EUR 9.2 billion is envisaged for a sustainable energy policy in the current period, with the key focuses being renewable energy and improving energy efficiency.
If the conciliation had been successful, we could now be jointly welcoming an imminent ban on the marketing of food from cloned animals.
The vote on this budget discharge definitively approves the increase in the expenditure of the European agency Frontex on its task of controlling our external borders.
It is not only important for children, for the very young children I have been talking about and the young people that my colleague has been talking about, but it is also important for the future of Europe. I therefore strongly support what the Commissioner has said, that Member States should now continue to invest in education and should not be using the economic climate to make cuts, because making cuts in education would be the worse possible thing to do.
The current economic, financial and social crisis has demonstrated that the European Union's current economic governance model has not worked the surveillance framework has shown itself to be very weak and the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact have not been respected. I therefore support the package of measures that the European Commission has tabled on economic governance. I endorse Mrs Ferreira's report on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances. I congratulate the Commission on the idea of introducing a scoreboard, which has already given good results in the fields of the internal market and the area of freedom, security and justice. I would like the European Parliament to be able to provide expert help to the Commission in defining the indicators on the scoreboard.
The situation is particularly serious for the most vulnerable economies of the euro area, which are considered to have 'excessive deficits' and could be subjected to severe sanctions.
Since these products can be freely imported, proving their origin is apparently unnecessary, but there are still some doubts about this facilitating measure. I cannot fail to stress the need to ensure the quality of products sold within Europe and to guarantee the safety of those who use them.
If necessary, we must also apply extreme measures - various economic sanctions and restrictions - against countries and companies which consistently ignore them.
These exceptions should remain exceptions, for I cannot emphasise strongly enough that reintroducing border controls is not a desirable development for Europe, neither in the current circumstances nor in relation to the future challenges that we will face sooner or later.
They, however, are seeking a solution in false answers, for example in the form of additional governmental capital injections pumped into banks or in further Brussels centralisation.
We must call on the Heads of State or Government to ensure that this becomes a joint European issue in the Council.
Turning to Schengen, I agree with you - or most of you - who have said that Schengen is a fantastic achievement.
It thus represents a massive step forward for markets that are more competitive but also safer, since greater rapprochement and cooperation in matters of certification, inspections and enforcement should enable the parties to ensure a higher level of security for passengers and cargo flights.
However, I am pleased that in recent years, we have succeeded in implementing almost all the provisions of the Small Business Act in the European Union.
Years ago, I was having dinner with the late President Gerald Ford in the United States and he was describing to me how the G7 came about.
We can therefore say in good faith that we will not succeed in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy unless we support small and medium-sized enterprises and unless we make it easier for them to make full use of the single market.
I voted in favour of this report because it highlights how important it is for young people to have a multidisciplinary education, as far as the targets of the EU 2020 strategy are concerned.
Parliament underlines that the Court of Auditors has stated that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular.
In other words, we need to view from the opposite side, too.
We must ensure that education and care are available to all families and children, regardless of their origin or the financial situation of the parents. I very much dislike resorting to pragmatic, financial arguments in questions of human rights, and in matters that should be obvious and as independent as possible of the economic situation.
After considering the reasons for and against defending the Member's parliamentary immunity, I agree with the recommendation of the Committee on Legal Affairs that Parliament should not defend the immunity of Bruno Gollnisch.
What I hope, and what my group is hoping - as, I think, are the majority in this Parliament - is that we can end this Summit with a more decisive, more comprehensive and bolder approach to the current crisis.
However, let me add a side comment on that point. I have rather grave reservations about the Museum of European History, in particular, not about the content of the project in itself, but about the costs associated with it. Obviously, it is good that we are going to have such a museum, but what disturbs me greatly about this is that, in this plenary chamber, we have never really had a serious debate about this project.
With 42 of our European expenditure going on the CAP, it is vital that we provide complete accountability to our citizens.
The administration of antimicrobials to animals has to take into account the potential threat of AMR in humans, frequently caused by inadequate doses of antibiotic medicines, by incorrect treatments and through the constant exposure of pathogens to antimicrobial agents in hospitals.
Account is taken of specific challenges such as the demand for ever-increasing qualifications by the labour market, which puts low-skilled jobs at risk, the spiralling increase in youth unemployment, which is over 30 in certain EU Member States, including Greece, and the failure on the part of the Member States to take adequate measures to achieve the targets set in the EU 2020 strategy for example, to reduce the percentage of early school leavers to 10 and to increase the percentage of young people with a university education to 40. Alongside social protection for citizens with fewer skills or a low level of education, we urgently need investment in new skills, especially those required for jobs in strategic sectors as far as growth is concerned.
Secondly, we find it hard to imagine Parliament approving a trade deal with Canada while Canada pursues a challenge, through the WTO, on the EU's trade ban.
The overwhelming majority of farms are owned by men. I believe that women should be supported to ensure that this imbalance is corrected.
It is noted that the register must be kept in a manner consistent with the right of Members to perform their parliamentary duties without restriction and must not be used as a pretext to deny their voters access to Parliament's premises.
She not only has a very good knowledge of the European economy and EU decision making, which is a merit in these times, but also very strong experience in global economic governance - through her successful management of the G20 Presidency, for instance.
They know Sri Lanka and they know what is going on. I do not know where Ms Delli is getting all this nonsense from.
In fact, Agriculture Ministers are holding an extraordinary Council meeting today to address E coli.
We have drawn on research from around the world, and my report looks at the following issues engagement with parents, which is very important for early years for young children; staff and the quality of services and qualifications required; and integrating early years services with the rest of the education systems in Member States.
It would be appropriate that, in areas of exclusive competence, the EU should be the pre-eminent actor, with full membership, while the Member States might also - but not necessarily - be present as members, without, in most cases, an independent role.
Deportations in Europe reached a peak, in particular, in the middle of the century as a result of the Nazi regime and the Communist regime of the Soviet Union.
Instead, we are merely reminding our friends how democracy works.
You need power lines to do this.
The European Union is made up of a rich and diverse mix of educational traditions, with early years education provided in a number of different ways across the continent. I voted for this report which, although it acknowledges that an EU approach to early childhood education services would be difficult to implement, encourages the development of a single European framework comprising shared goals and values, including shared entitlements and structures.
The good and bad aspects of the report will come out in today's debate, both praise and criticism. I know it is impossible for this Chamber to give its unanimous support on such a sensitive issue, but I would like to thank the political groups for their generosity in seeking consensus, and the skills they have contributed over this period.
We are just suggesting that the Commission not turn its back on a sector that urgently needs aid, and this aid can, today, be an increase in de minimis aid.
Secondly, the removal - as has already been said - of the regulatory and administrative barriers which impede the free movement, within the Schengen area, of those in the cultural sector, in particular, for third-country nationals, by introducing, for instance, common accelerated procedures within the European Union for short and long-term visas, as well as a single procedure for obtaining work permits in the Union. I strongly urge the Commission to continue its work in these areas.
As far as free movement of persons is concerned, let me tell you that at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 9 June the Hungarian Presidency unanimously adopted a conclusion stating that free movement has to be preserved, that we need to revise the measures already available to us, and only after we have exhausted them and only if new problems actually arise, requiring the adjustment of our current acquis, can we take extraordinary measures in extraordinary situations, and that the modalities should only be elaborated once there is a concrete legislative proposal at hand, which, as far as I know, will happen this autumn.
The report talks us through the ways in which our common cultural image and the artistic achievements of small nations and Member States of the European Union in contact with the cultures of other nations can raise the standard of our public debate and even ease our diplomats' and strategists' burden in finding solutions to innumerable crises, at home and around us. By refusing to observe borders, new media and new technologies are opening up immense opportunities in the process. I would have liked the report to have devoted a word or two to books, to the idea, for example, that books should not be subject to taxation.
These new concessions are absurd, since they are concentrated in a sector - textiles - which is a dominant sector in Pakistan but which in Europe, on the other hand, has been destroyed precisely as a result of unfair competition from Asian countries.
The ruling made on 31 May by the European Court of Human Rights and violations in Russia of the European Convention on Human Rights are facts that must also be discussed.
The report's ideological framework suddenly becomes clear the problem of employment is a problem for the individual and not an eminently social one, with the individual - and not society - having to solve it, whether by increasing their 'employability' or by becoming an 'entrepreneur'; a tax system that is profit-friendly and, therefore, imposed mainly on workers and consumers; and education and training totally at the beck and call of capital.
I voted for this report because the full application of the Schengen agreement in Bulgaria and Romania certainly means the abolition of border checks for these countries as well.
However, the report submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety relating to the Green Paper on forest protection and information introduces a rising tide of regulation, without acknowledging the importance of the forests as a job creator and an economic engine.
By developing the CCIs, we are contributing to sustainable economic development and job creation.
Mr El Khadraoui has done tremendous work to reach a good compromise and to have a good proposal for this compromise. I sincerely ask you to please support this compromise.
This report, drafted by Mrs Goulard, is on the legislative proposal for amending Council Regulation EC No 146797, on budgetary surveillance in the euro area, which is part of the economic governance package, adopted by the Commission on 29 September 2010, seeking to 'anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances' so as to make the EU more robust and sustainable.
In the run-up to the 66th ordinary session of the UN General Assembly, the European Parliament, as usual, addressed its recommendations to the Council, representing the Member States, who are the only fully fledged members of the organisation.
The aim of the proposal is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products with a view to encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres.
Furthermore, the data could be monitored more easily if high quality information were available regarding the interaction between environmental and economic factors environmental economic accounts could contribute to policy evaluation by making available data concerning the environmental impact of economic activities.
However, there is often a big gap between theory and reality, despite Parliament having been the first EU institution to deal with the phenomenon of the growing number of interest groups at European level and, in particular, with the consequences of this development for the legislative process.
It is also entirely appropriate to move across gradually to a system of own resources for the EU, thereby replacing the current system of Member State contributions, as this leads to comparisons of the balance between the EU and Member States, causing the general public to draw the wrong conclusions over the meaning of EU membership, which is an entirely mistaken conclusion given the current interconnectedness of economies and policies.
Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director-General of the Euratom Supply Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has submitted a motion for a debate on the selection process of a new Managing Director for the IMF and external representation of the euro, directly after Jo Leinen's report on European environmental economic accounts.
We should either get rid of paragraph 29 or change it to say that we are concerned about goods that might be made using child labour.
These matters impact on one another, and that is why I am trying to explain here that, unless we are prepared to make changes now, the public are not going to back us and we will lose out in the significant, major issues.
If used correctly, antibiotics are an effective tool, but I call on the Commission to introduce concrete measures to make their use more efficient so as to reduce animals' resistance to antibiotics, as this is a problem that impacts on the entire food chain.
We have many discussions on how funds are distributed between the Member States, but we also need to discuss how they are allocated within Member States.
As rapporteur in previous years for the subject of better law making, I would like to highlight several aspects of this problem.
Europe is in need of well-educated immigrants who reach Europe in compliance with the regulations, and of a common migration policy with adequate resources.
The discharge procedure has allowed the Commission to learn from the conclusions and recommendations of the European Court of Auditors and the resolution of the discharge authority at a time when we are considering the future design of EU policies and their reflection in the EU budget.
However, I do hope that after the good quality work they have done on a professional level, they will have enough political weight and agility to reach important goals in other areas, such as the Croatian accession, migration and the very pressing issue of economic governance.
This report is part of the package of six pieces of legislation on economic governance and reveals the contradictions that exist in the European Union.
What is the risk of the assets on the balance sheets, and can you trust the risk weights applied to those assets If US banks have risk weights 50 higher than European counterparts, are Europe's banks being allowed to fundamentally misrepresent the risks on their balance sheets
We therefore need to oppose this new secular religion and madness, which is placing a question mark over whether there was any sense at all in countries such as Poland joining the European Union, since it would be forced to spend much more money on reducing CO2 emissions than its net gains from cohesion policy to date.
This really concerns us, not because we do not believe that the focus of the cohesion policy should be extended, but because we think that without additional resources, this extension risks depriving and reducing the resources for the areas referred to in Objective 1 - the so-called convergence objective - which need just as much attention and support from the European Union.
The appropriate attention should be focused on young people, who are at the heart of this umbrella programme, and jobs and opportunities for affirmation should be created for them because they are the European citizens on whom we will be depending in the future.
The International Labour conference, which will take place in June this year, will be the chance for members of the International Labour Organisation to adopt a 'Convention on decent work for domestic workers'. This instrument is a step in the right direction for the rights of workers across the world since it extends labour law standards to domestic workers, a category who, until now, were excluded from these standards.
My question to you, Mr Barroso, is can you confirm that this is also the position of the Commission Secondly, as time is pressing, will you propose these changes to the rescue mechanism at the next European Council meeting in two weeks' time
Of course, the idea would be to eliminate 100 of tariffs, which normally you would not have with a developing or an emerging economy.
The commission tabled a proposal for a directive on consumer rights in 2008, has drafted two progress reports and has now tabled a series of measures in the form of a Green Paper, to which this report seeks to respond.
Coupled with the 'one in, one out' policy for regulation that my own government is operating, these measures should begin to achieve our objective.
The charge will reflect not just road infrastructure costs, the vehicle's pollution category and length of journey, but also the level of pollution, noise and congestion.
The sustainable management of radioactive waste and spent fuel must include the waste's life cycle from generation to temporary or final storage, as well as during the post-closure period of the storage facilities and restoring the environment.
It is often said that the level of development of a human society can be measured by how it cares for its most vulnerable and deprived members.
Apart from the threat of accident or terrorist attack, there is also considerable evidence of adverse health effects along Ireland's eastern seaboard attributed to Sellafield discharges.
This crisis calls the European agricultural model itself into question and tests the functioning of the Internal Market.
These funds should, in fact, be increased, so that everyone, regardless of their age, gender or location, has access to the same opportunities in terms of vocational education and careers.
Despite the decree issued by the President in March of this year in which he officially authorised a longer stay in Guantanamo for some prisoners, the Union hopes - no, in fact, expects - the government of the United States to continue to discuss this subject in Congress and to work towards closing the detention camp as quickly as possible.
By adopting the report by Mrs Fraga Estevez at lunchtime today, Parliament has given its approval for the European Union to enter into a binding international agreement to combat illegal fishing, thereby demonstrating its commitment to responsible fishing also.
Furthermore, owing to the European Union's high degree of dependency on imports from third countries 60, producers have very little or even no influence on the price levels of fisheries products. I agree that the ceiling on de minimis aid should be raised from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm for a transitional period of three years, while ensuring that environmental and social sustainability are not undermined and that competition between Member States is not distorted.
I am voting for the amended Commission proposal having regard to the interinstitutional agreement of 20 December 1994 on an accelerated working method for the official codification of legislative texts and, in particular, to point 4 thereof.
The register lacks relevant information.
How could I remain indifferent about a text on pluralism and the concentration of power in regulatory authorities such as those set out in the still fresh Hungarian media law We should all worry about democracy when a ruling party passes laws that cement its power well beyond the end of its term and limits the relevance of future elections, and about political leaders going as far as writing or amending fundamental laws that fit only their political credo or economic policies.
In this regard, I must highlight the differences in sanitary standards.
We must finally make consistent use of the Stability and Growth Pact, which forms the basis for the strong euro, in order to show the Member States with high budget deficits where the limits are.
There needs to be a substantial change in the international order so that the EU can better overcome its challenges using concerted global action. I would also draw attention to the fact that, according to Article 21 of the Treaty, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism and to the role of the UN in particular.
The transformation of the EU into a European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NATO, as advocated by the Treaty of Lisbon, entails involvement in conflict zones at international level.
Europe, too, recognises the need to pursue projects aiming at economic and industrial growth, by focusing resources and investment on innovative policies, without abandoning the path it has followed in recent decades of playing a leading and guiding role in economic and social development.
The second person I would like to mention is Andrzej Poczobut, a journalist who writes for Gazeta Wyborcza, one of Poland's largest newspapers. I and hundreds of thousands of Poles would like to appeal for his release.
To be in a position to negotiate with the Union, third countries must comply with internationally established labour standards.
That is not necessarily the case - it can also relate to social innovation.
First of all, if we are going to discuss the content of a constitution, we should not single out one constitution of one Member State.
This is a first step towards developing more comprehensive environmental accounting since, according to the competent European and national statistics offices, it is only in these areas that data for the whole of Europe is currently available.
Syria's citizens have been demonstrating for nearly two months and they must not be left on their own to fight for democracy.
However, the problems that affect them, including poverty and social exclusion, unemployment, housing shortages, crime and drug consumption, are huge and require careful attention.
There remains one other matter that was always regarded as a red-line issue and that is public procurement.
As a rule, agencies carry out external evaluations of their work programmes at regular intervals, and these take such performance indicators into account.
The Ecofin Council met on Monday and once again made amendments to the compromises that had been negotiated.
Despite the many proposals that have been seen through in the last three years - I am thinking of the Late Payments Directive in particular - a lot of progress remains to be achieved to make things easier for small and medium-sized enterprises, not only in respect of the administrative burden they have to deal with, but also the difficulty in accessing funding that they experience.
On this front, the effort made on the idea of introducing an intermediate category of regions is particularly important, above all, because in a number of cases, the years of recession that we are emerging from have intensified internal divisions, further increasing the importance of effective and adequate support for less developed regions in Europe, combating wastage and bringing development policy sharply into focus.
It is a proven tool and, according to the Decision, the cornerstone of cooperation and the first concrete example of the principal of mutual recognition in the sphere of criminal law.
We have tried to produce an appraisal that corresponds to the current situation as far as possible.
First, on proportionality just to make it clear, a European Arrest Warrant can be issued to prosecute offences which are punishable by at least 12 months' imprisonment, or to execute a sentence to at least 4 months' imprisonment.
The reaction to the thousands of refugees who are literally being washed ashore in the south of Europe cannot possibly be considered a valid reason for us to start closing our internal borders, even temporarily.
We look forward to early ratification by those Member States and, indeed, some interesting implementation.
However, in order, at the same time, to be credible when asking for more money, we must also have the courage to look at existing structures and existing costs.
In particular, the Court identified severe shortcomings in the enforcement of the financial rules on public procurement and of the rules governing expenditure on the organisation of courses.
The chair of the Euro Group would be better able than I to give you further details on many of these points.
Mr President, in this case, too, the text is included in the voting list. I would just like to make one comment the subject is the protest against the condemnation of demonstrators in Bahrain and criticism of that conduct.
Given his experience in this area, I believe I can safely endorse his evaluation, and his demands for external border security.
We need clearer labels to indicate where animal products are used to make a garment, in particular, in the case of fur and fur trim. I voted in favour of the report because it deals with providing detailed information that is urgently needed by citizens, who have the right to know where their textiles come from and what materials they are made of.
The review's five guidelines to reduce pressure on SMEs include simplifying the rules on VAT and reducing the rates, and a directive on late payments, but that is just tinkering with existing rules and regulations.
This aims to remove the current physical, administrative and regulatory obstacles and alleviate the 'border effect' between territories and regions, permitting them to address their shared challenges together, whether these be territorial, global, economic or societal.
We would not wish to strike German consumers the extra blow of depriving them of foods that are absolutely essential for their diet and their health.
So, having lobbyists or stakeholders with conflicting interests is a good thing what is important is that the judge - and therefore also the MEP - maintains his freedom of thought, independence, and his honest search for the common good.
It does not surprise me at all, and I do not think it surprised honourable Members either, that on the way to this, particularly at a time when so many things are happening, we find that it does not necessarily work as effectively as you would like, or indeed sometimes as I would like.
Furthermore, due to the constant technological changes, employers have ever-increasing expectations with regard to employees' qualifications.
The Court of Auditors says that the 2009 accounts, on which we have just voted, are materially affected by error and that is why I am very pleased that the British Conservatives and our good friends in the European Conservatives have voted against discharge of these accounts.
In all the measures that we undertake we must ensure the safety of the general public and the environment. I support the implementation of the 'safety culture', which entails the provision of safety standards, independent and strong regulators, suitable human and financial resources and sufficient information to the general public.
This is a feeling felt by many Member States with regard to the Schengen area and we should not rush with further expansion before all involved are fully and sufficiently ready and prepared.
Regrettably, in the area of external relations, the country currently holding the Presidency cannot shape a programme for foreign affairs, common defence or security, and thus, my fellow Members, you have no other choice than to support Mrs Ashton's work, which is starting with great difficulty.
If we succeed in simplifying this system - and we have launched an initiative to this end together with Commissioner Barnier - we will also reduce the practical error rate in this area, too.
Indeed, whether it is a question of waste resulting from activities relating to the production of electricity or activities in other areas such as medicine, research and industry, the export of radioactive waste to third countries is an irresponsible practice that has been condemned by Parliament in adopting this report.
As shadow rapporteur for the Group of the European People's Party Christian Democrats, I am very satisfied with the final document.
Although it mentions that the radio spectrum is 'a key public resource for essential sectors and services', the report points the way towards the 'possibility to trade spectrum rights' and invites the Commission to adopt measures 'to ensure that Member States allow trading within the Union of spectrum usage rights'; once again, we do not agree with these guidelines and we would distance ourselves from them.
The negotiations between the European Parliament and the Commission in relation to the transparency register are a success and we have now produced an excellent result. I would like to underline once again that it is good that we have found clear regulations for the local and regional authorities, and even for churches, that reflect their interests.
The rapporteur clearly states that, in spite of the constructiveness of the dialogue with the Commission, the Commission itself did not change its behaviour in development matters as Parliament recommended.
We have also realised that coordination of fiscal policies through the SGP might not be sufficient in a Union sharing a single currency so we have agreed to introduce a new mechanism to tackle macroeconomic imbalances, which will be treated on the same footing as fiscal imbalances.
Mr President, the Group of the European People's Party Christian Democrats has concerns about the European banking sector stress test which is to take place in June, because last year's stress test lacked credibility and the consequences of that were painfully obvious when the Irish banks that passed the test landed in serious trouble shortly thereafter.
The Union budget is the main mechanism for activating solidarity between the Member States and is a strong tool for a reform that could mobilise additional private and public resources to support investments that will act as a catalyst in terms of the exponential effect of spending by the Union.
It is more of an asset because of the observation of the legal structure presented, looking to clarify the institutional barriers verified in the post-Treaty of Lisbon period and trying to specify legislative solutions for any problems that are identified 'Lisbon' requires a CSDP. I feel that the European public wants it. The new reality will be more rational, more synergistic and more European.
The same goes for checking and controlling the information that is circulating.
We are having to express an opinion on a proposal for a directive on nuclear waste based on the Euratom Treaty and our Parliament only has a consultative opinion on this text, which is something I regret. I hope that the Council will take due account of our position.
Resistance to antibiotics is a serious problem affecting the livestock industry, so I share the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development's concerns on this issue and agree with its proposals, not just to reduce animals' resistance to treatment with antibiotics, but also to encourage other means of combating animal diseases that do not necessarily involve the use of antibiotics.
You had a perfect example of that with the new restrictions and bans on herbal and alternative medicines which came in a couple of weeks ago.
by Georgios Stavrakakis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Training Foundation for the financial year 2009 SEC20100963 - C7-02352010 -;
My support for this report recognises the excellent work carried out by Mr Mikolasik and hopes that cohesion policy, even in the next programming period, continues on its path of aggregation and development of territories and the European economy.
I call on the British Prime Minister to reduce the UK's contribution to the EU in line with the amount of the irregularities if the European Parliament fails to act in the interests of the British taxpayer.
Let me now turn to some of the amendments that have been proposed. I will not go into detail on all of them, but let me highlight the most important ones. I know that there are requests for making the granting of autonomous trade preferences conditional upon Pakistan respecting certain fundamental principles. I understand the concerns that may exist in that respect, and you are aware that human rights issues are an integral element of our long-term relationship with Pakistan.
Those in power in Hungary have just used the two-thirds majority for exactly the opposite purpose to exclude the opposition, ensuring that the constitution is extremely controversial in their society.
Great emphasis is placed on strengthening the European Urban Agenda, on developing basic physical infrastructure and its contribution to the economic fabric, and on energy and environmental sustainability through investment based on technological progress, but people are sidelined.
In my opinion, it is therefore essential to take steps to create a European Credit Rating Agency, which could work towards a new model of credit rating and create the conditions for developing genuine competitiveness.
Going back to the Arsenis report, on Amendment 25, one of my colleagues over there requested a roll-call vote because he felt it was important.
On the basis of this diagnosis, then, we need to improve the situation.
The industry and Parliament should recognise that disposal and reprocessing is also a transnational policy area that cannot be left to individual Member States.
The European Union is a major international player on issues regarding the management of fishing.
Given the importance of the European telecommunications industry and information technologies for higher productivity and competitiveness in our market, I am voting for the radio spectrum policy programme. I believe in the ability of this programme to create the conditions necessary for successful competition with the new technology markets of China and the US, as well as maintaining European leadership in the telecommunications industry.
It is supposed to be the guardian of European law, including the legislation that we have adopted, but when it comes to the trade agreement with Canada, it says that it is important that some people make a lot of money, but it is not important for European law to remain law. I do not understand how the Commission can say that we do not need to discuss the import ban on seal products in connection with these matters.
An additional fine for Member States falsifying their fiscal statistics is also provided for, at the initiative of the Parliament.
I would like to remind this House that in March 2009, we adopted a resolution which took into account both the trade and the non-trade concerns.
The European Union needs to do more to support the International Labour Organisation, since it is absurd that, while we profess support, fewer and fewer countries are ratifying and respecting the conventions.

We can help Russia come to terms with its past.
The next item is the debate on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances; excessive deficit procedure; requirements for budgetary frameworks of Member States; budgetary surveillance in the euro area; surveillance of budgetary positions and surveillance and coordination of economic policies; and enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area.
I particularly welcome the call for at least 70 of budget funding to be spent on territorial cooperation in cross-border collaboration, on the one hand, and for the funding for territorial cooperation to be increased from a level of 2.5 in the current programming period to at least 7 of total budget funding in the next programming period.
The document specifically identifies the priorities of the European Parliament, placing the need for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy, at the centre of the 2012 budget.
In more than 600 patients, the dangerous haemolytic uremic syndrome HUS was diagnosed, which can also result in neurological disorders.
Although the vote on appointing certain European oligarchs is, according to regulation, a secret ballot, I am keen to let it be known that I voted against Mr Draghi,. because there is really something deeply unhealthy and perverse, in the middle of the sovereign debt crisis, about appointing a former European director of Goldman Sachs.
This is especially important for the European Parliament, because often the issues faced by MEPs are very complex and technical and we almost always need to find a balance between businesses and countries with divergent interests.
My central concerns are consumer protection, food safety in the use of these novel products, and correct information. I therefore believe there must be total traceability for consumers, especially for natural products, for which we already find it difficult to guarantee traceability.
I voted for this report giving discharge to the Committee of the Regions CoR, and I am pleased that, in our resolution, Parliament 'reconfirms its position that, in the interests of transparency, declarations of financial interests of members of all Union institutions should be accessible on the Internet via a public register; reminds the CoR of its request that CoR members declare their financial interests, disclosing relevant information on declarable professional activities and remunerated posts or activities; notes with satisfaction the CoR response on the matter, in particular the letter of the president of the CoR of 11 February 2011; and requests the CoR to follow up this issue in its Annual Activity Report'.

I voted against the removal of the Parliamentary immunity of Bruno Gollnisch because 1. I believe in free speech and the words complained of were not incitements to violence and were not abusive or insulting.
The first is a fight about principle - who should pay for the use of infrastructures and what specifically they should pay for.
Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union establishes that the EU 'shall develop and pursue its actions leading to the strengthening of its economic, social and territorial cohesion', and it has therefore set Union funds for the 2007-2013 period at EUR 347 billion, which corresponds to 35.7 of the overall EU budget. I am voting in favour of this report as it sets out an accurate analysis of the current state of Union funds by demonstrating the areas in which, up until now, EUR 93.4 million has been spent, suggests recommendations and areas for improvement, contributes to resolving the economic and financial crisis, and promotes best practices and mutual learning at regional level.
First of all, when it comes to the increase in oil prices, there are actually two sectors which are exempt from all energy taxes already and those are aviation and shipping - including fisheries.
The Japanese market is currently subject to barriers, non-tariff barriers, as my fellow Members have also mentioned, which restrict import access, thereby impacting as a whole on trade activities and investments.
We need a budget that is designed for the challenges of the present day and that can provide a strong and innovative response to current needs.
Those who do more, those who show that they deserve more, will receive more.
The European consumer, of course, certainly benefits from India's cheap labour force, as reflected, for example, in lower prices for products, but that should not be allowed if India's primary producers are going to suffer.
The difficulties that Romania and Bulgaria still face - organised crime and corruption - are, undoubtedly, serious accusations against the governments of these countries, which should combat these phenomena more effectively.
For this reason, the conditions are 20 for Europe alone and 30 if we have partners, in other words, the US or China. I believe that this is a serious, far-reaching and fair offer.
Do not push EU culture; make Italian, German, French, Dutch, British and all the other cultures available for all who want to sample them, and the rest will follow.
By the end of June, we are expecting a new Managing Director to have been appointed for the International Monetary Fund IMF to succeed Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who has, as we all know, been accused of a very serious crime that, unfortunately, has probably also damaged the reputation of the IMF.
I think that there is just one point that has not yet been made here today and that is the need to acknowledge that Europe is now some way behind in terms of research and innovation.
It states that projects that have a substantial impact on the environment must undergo an assessment in which all their direct, but also indirect, effects on the environment are evaluated.
One need only think of the register of interest representatives adopted by the European Parliament in 1996, or of the Commission's 2006 proposal to the European Parliament for a 'one-stop shop' register for lobbyists.
Has the Commission included processed canned fish products as part of food aid packages sent by the European Union to countries suffering from a humanitarian crisis Would the Commission not agree that processed canned fish products are ideally suited for food aid as the product is high in protein, has a long shelf life and can be supplied at short notice
I have absolute respect for Mr Rutte, who is in favour of a 2.7 increase in the EU budget. I have taken note of this and am pleased that you have listened attentively because the positions of all governments are debated openly in this Parliament.
While we have managed to agree on the way forward with Parliament's delegations, the implementation of the solution found still requires some time.

The current crisis in this region is obviously part of the wider crisis of capitalism and is being aggravated by its impact however, it is deeply rooted in a long history of interference, aggression and military occupation, promoted by the EU and its main powers, and the US, seeking to impose their economic and political dominance on the region.
Mr Assange arrived in Sweden less than a month after WikiLeaks leaked the Afghanistan war logs and announced it had many more revelations to come.
Last but not least, the European Research Council does an excellent job, and the work that it funds should be made widely available to the public as quickly as possible. I would like to expressly thank Mr Audy once again for supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, and as Mr Correia De Campos also said, the 'Eurostars' programme could become one of the major projects of the future.
However, the fact that we do not have the Council's agreement in the dialogue on economic policy and that the European Parliament and the two sides of industry are involved in this is reducing our ability to become more integrated.
Yes, we are drawing the conclusions from Fukushima.
This heterogeneity is also confirmed by the finding that 75 of the overall EUR 21 billion assigned for financial support was made fully available through the intermediary banks, which was drawn on by just 50 000 out of the total of 23 million SMEs.
In my opinion, this should be followed by specific measures, including financial measures and economic sanctions, which will allow the restoration of freedom and democracy in Belarus.
In essence, it confirms many of the warnings and alerts that we made as the Treaty of Lisbon was being debated and then brought into force an irrefutable course of EU militarisation is under way, and it is now being accelerated and intensified.
Given that the main economic activities in Seychelles are fishing and tourism, and that this agreement benefits both the EU and the Republic of Seychelles, in view of the creation of 3 000 jobs in Seychelles and 760 in Europe and the monitoring of catches through a multiannual sectoral programme which provides for scientific cooperation and the promotion of responsible and sustainable fisheries, I am voting in favour of this proposal for a recommendation.
Brussels could not care less about Turkey's Armenian genocide.
There were minor problems with the agencies, I do not have time to elaborate on it, but in general we must say that their financial management is acceptable and should be supported.
Clearly, every debate on discharge has its own particular context, and the context of today's debate is the economic and financial crisis, which has caused financial and budgetary problems for a number of Member States.
In the political sphere, we saw on Tuesday this Parliament's attitude to freedom of expression when it voted to hand over a Member of this House for a show trial in France for a thought-crime offence, without even being given the opportunity to defend himself.
Rather than assessing quality of life and the environment on the basis of impressions, we need to come up with better data and better methods of data collection and aggregation so that they deliver an improved service in gauging, for example, the environmental impact made by policies and economic activities.
Therefore, I believe that the system of yearly fines for non-compliance with these rules, as proposed in the report, should be supported and, above all, strictly applied.
This report comes in the wake of the previously drafted Lyon report on the broad strokes of common agricultural policy CAP reform, and of the Commission communication on the CAP, of which it is largely in favour.
Mr President, Commissioner, you are right that this is a public health issue, a very serious one, and our focus should now be on caring for the sick and identifying the source, but then we have to look to the long term and find out how we stop it happening again.
It proposes extending and expanding common policies, in particular, cohesion policy which has made a major contribution in the past to making the European Union a model of cooperation and understanding between peoples, and may continue to do so in the future.
We know - as it has indeed been demonstrated over the last few years - that credit rating agencies CRAs are not credible, but their actions, nonetheless, remain very damaging, especially to countries with weaker economies, and they make a living, above all, from disproportionately stimulating credit and capitalist financial speculation.
That is why I have called on the Commission to put forward proposals aimed at supplementing Regulation EU No 9952010 on timber in order to ensure that timber and products derived from such timber placed on the European market all come from sustainably managed forests.
We have been told that the fire service and the police are responsible for them. I imagine that al-Qaeda and other terrorists will almost die laughing when they find out that the fire service and the police are responsible for preventing the threat of terrorism.
Lastly, we think that the Council should obtain Parliament's consent before signing any further international commercial agreements, and that Parliament should be kept informed throughout all phases of the procedure in order to guarantee greater democratic control.
Firstly, we need to encourage the mobility and attractiveness of cultural factors, such as the mobility of artists, cultural workers and works of art and, secondly, we need to ensure that specific funding and economic support policies are put in place in the cultural sector, such as access to funds via the European Investment Bank.
If Japan demonstrates a real willingness to eliminate non-tariff barriers, I believe the EU should enter into negotiations with Japan with a view to signing a free trade agreement.
We believe that the wording of the report which makes cohesion policy subject to conditions that force the Member States to implement reforms is unclear and liable to misinterpretation.
I am voting in favour of this agreement as I consider it essential that the position adopted by the European Commission, and stressed in this report, expresses the fact that Parliament should regularly monitor the entire process through the sharing of information, and that the Commission should submit a report analysing the strengths and weaknesses of the existing agreements at least every three years.
Mr President, no one will disagree that terrorism needs to be prevented and that suspects need to be tried and held accountable, brought to justice in a fair trial, but in the so-called war on terror, we risk compromising precisely those freedoms and values that we claim to defend against destruction through terrorism.
Therefore, we must make it clear to Russia that we want a partnership based on equality and on common interests.
But I am afraid some of the amendments to which the Commission has already made reference take away from the spirit of our initial intentions and the initial way in which we reacted.
It is 20 years since the Soviet Union collapsed, but for President Lukashenko of Belarus, it is as if nothing has changed at all.

If we want to achieve this ambitious goal, I believe that the financial resources the EU has need to be just as ambitious.
I am voting for this report, but I believe that a potential optional system could be beneficial for consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises if the Commission puts forward concrete data that indicate a need for further progress in order for the consultation carried out by the Commission to remain transparent.
Their objective is to close down the nuclear industry and they have a fixed objective.
I should like to welcome the introduction of a mechanism of sanctions for correcting macroeconomic imbalances, in line with what is happening at the moment with the Stability and Growth Pact rules.

Amnesty International and Medecins sans Frontieres have also expressed extreme concern over the safety of those involved and indeed the motivation behind their arrests. I fully support the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation and the International Council of Nurses, and indeed a number of Irish doctors, who are adding their voices in condemnation of these awful events.
My report deals with numerous deficiencies and puts forward proposals in the hope that the Commission will perhaps be able to include some of them in its legislative proposal that it will be tabling in the autumn.
An announcement today in that direction would certainly be helpful for Egypt and for the Egyptians.

We would like to hear the speech of Commissioner Viviane Reding on these issues.
At present we are seeing time and again in Greece, Portugal and Ireland that, under pressure from the European Commission, in negotiations with the national governments results and packages have been put together in which it is the weakest that suffer, and in which the wealthy - who did very well out of the previous 20 years - are left alone.
EU governments will continue to have the option of imposing universal public service obligations on private operators and of subsidising public services as necessary.
Proposals to this end have been made in the context of the Quality Package, including reducing the time for the Commission to scrutinise applications received to six months and reducing the objection period to two months.
Firstly, I believe that we should create the inventory proposed in Article 8; it is preferable to rely on a precise, expertly prepared inventory so as to identify new bands before explicitly mentioning harmonised frequency bands.
Allowing the sale of a higher percentage of tractors calibrated to the old, more permissive emission limits will actually serve to protect the economic interests of this strategic manufacturing sector, without altering the environmental protection objectives that have already been laid down.
I welcomed this document because Europe needs to take action immediately, especially where young people are concerned rising youth unemployment is one of Europe's most pressing challenges.
Preparing forests for climate change

The fact is that neither NATO nor the UN wants the EU pretending to get involved militarily.

I am in favour of consenting to the European Union's participation in the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area entered into by Greece, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. I take this view because the park is a natural area of international importance, owing to its geomorphology, ecology, biodiversity and cultural significance. I also support the objectives and the principles outlined in the agreement, which are based on the sustainable use of natural resources, a focus on the conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity, and the prevention, control and reduction of water pollution in the Prespa Lakes.
The proposal not only protects the existence, but also ensures the future development, of those valuable cultural and economic services which, by the way, produce rich media content and feed future data highways with attractive cultural offerings.

The key aim of these measures is to revitalise the Western Balkan economies through privileged access to the EU market.
Madam President, dodgy scams, which are fraudulent in nature and prey on small businesses using a veil of legitimacy - often with Europe in their titles - must be made illegal.
Unfortunately, the Seventh Framework Programme also includes funding for research in the field of nuclear power.

Given the tragedy that has struck the region of Murcia and specifically, the town of Lorca, I should like to express, on behalf of the Presidency, our solidarity with that community and with all the victims, several of whom have been killed.

While I welcome the Commissioner's statement, I confirm that I am against any attempt to implement protectionist measures in a sector in which Europe actually hindered access to low cost medicines in the past.

The most important aspect with regard to this data is the quantity of data.

Although we do now have earmarking to a very limited extent - 15 of infrastructure costs and 15 of external costs must go to the TEN-T networks - it is really far too little.

We all have to act in reforming our societies.
My question to the Council is as follows is Europe of the 2020s the same as Europe of the 1960s Are the state of public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and the position of Europe in the world comparable I think not.

This also applies to the scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority EFSA, the methodology of which has been called into question on several occasions, and to public consultations, where the wording of the questions may lead one to expect answers that the Commission's services want to hear.
It is very keen to access the EU's services market and therefore, it is necessary to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of how the free trade agreement might affect the EU's services sectors and other important sectors and employment.
In my opinion, we need to establish good practices for animal husbandry which minimise the risk of antimicrobial resistance AMR. These practices should apply, in particular, to young animals which are brought together from different breeders and thus increase the risk of communicable diseases.
This must be demonstrated not only by appealing for free, pluralist elections to be organised and democratic order to be restored, but also, in practical terms, by providing proper humanitarian aid.

Without any involvement on the part of the Commission, WENRA applied its expertise and, following a circulation procedure, came up with a resolution that human error and human causes should not be included. I do not think this is adequate.
The stability of the euro area, in particular, and of Europe as a whole requires the restructuring of prevention and surveillance instruments, in order to correct macroeconomic imbalances.
The calling into question of publicpublic partnerships, the scaling down of standards by public authorities who are the guarantors of the general interest, need I remind you, the choices of these same public authorities leaning towards more competition ...

However through this vote, I call upon Parliament's President and the Members who are negotiating the Union budget on behalf of Parliament to suggest to the Council that it take steps to ensure that the Union can make these savings.

Yet the proposed solutions state that each country is to reduce debt to 60 within 20 years.

The amount paid by the European taxpayer should be exclusively used for development objectives, that is to say that it should be spent for the benefit of the fishing communities, so as to enhance their living conditions, to provide training programmes, to ensure safety at sea and to create new local jobs.
It is a long-term objective of territorial balance that we are pursuing with these objectives of intermediate regions, to prevent too big a gap between developed regions that are completely saturated and regions that are remote, lagging behind and even threatened with depopulation in tomorrow's Europe.
When I say that I am considering new guidelines on this issue, it is precisely in order to address one of the causes of the crisis - this crazy risk-taking - and to make those involved in the banking sector more prudent and responsible again.
We generally share core values, but the difference in our position on the death penalty, which I am proud to say is entirely banned in Europe, makes our joint voice less effective and less credible in the world.

It is important to note that unanimity between the Member States and the assent of the European Parliament are needed to take the final decision, not expected until at least June 2012.
Parliament and the Commission are moving in the same direction when it comes to the main aspects of the future development of regional policy and I would like to thank you for this. I want to make it quite clear that during the discussion about the transitional regions we rather lost sight of the fact that we have so much in common in this area, including shared priorities and very substantial proposals for changes in the future direction of the policy, which will make it even more successful, sustainable and visible and more comprehensible and tangible for the citizens of Europe.

They also refuse to allow the Ministers of Finance of those States whose public accounts are tipping into the red to be heard by Parliament.

Anyone who turns the constitutional right of an accused person to access their files into the exact opposite, in other words, into a compulsion to access the files, and anyone who does this, as in the case of Mr Lutsenko, by means of imprisonment and, in the case of Mrs Tymoshenko, by a total of 44 summonses so far, clearly demonstrates what sort of person he is and the fact that he is abusing the judicial system in the old-fashioned way for the purposes of political disputes.
In view of the complexity of the machinery of European law and national legislation, a single optional system that could be rolled out across the European Union is an appealing prospect, but is probably a Sisyphean task, as we will clearly be hampered by diverse legal systems, protests from the legal profession, and jurisdiction issues. I fear that it would be very difficult to establish, but let us give it a shot and see what happens.
On the other hand, the globalisation processes also offer a wide range of opportunities, challenges and threats for global governance, while revealing social loopholes and failures, including in areas such as the financial markets, energy security, the fight against poverty, climate change policy and human rights violations.

This motion for a resolution of the European Parliament concerns a free trade agreement FTA between the European Union and India.
Mr Aylward, I did say before you came in that we had 20 minutes per Commissioner, which would mean that we could possibly get to Question 15 by Mrs Blinkeviciute, but I am afraid I do not think we are going to make it to yours.
The forestry industries contribute to economic growth, they create opportunities for growth and employment in rural areas, and they encourage rural development through local industries and tourism opportunities.
May I first offer my sincerest congratulations to Mrs Wortmann-Kool on the work she has done on the economic governance package.
In this respect, the report highlights the need to strengthen dialogue with the European Commission at the different negotiation stages and in the monitoring of agreements in force.
Based on the report by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and following the processes of consultation and evaluation of the credentials of the nominee, specifically in light of the requirements set out in Article 2832 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU, and in view of the need for the European Central Bank ECB to be fully independent, I voted in favour of the report on the appointment of the President of the ECB, and I welcome Mr Draghi's appointment.
With the objective of overcoming the financial and economic crisis, and of protecting against any future crisis, public procurement is of crucial relevance, serving as a catalyst for the revitalisation of the EU economy and, accordingly, for employment and welfare in the EU. Therefore, a sound and properly thought-out process of optimising the legal framework for public procurement is of vital importance for the welfare of EU citizens, EU consumers and businesses, and for national, regional and local authorities.
There will be no internal protection without external protection.
In fact, I believe that the first step to be taken in preventing future economic crises is to analyse thoroughly the risk factors that may lead to budgetary imbalances, and this report duly addresses this issue.
For these reasons, I voted in favour of this European Parliament resolution on equal access to public sector markets in the EU and in third countries, and on the revision of the public procurement legal framework, including concessions.
What is needed is a common approach, a long-term vision as called for by the Commission, to respond to citizens' concerns on security.
During the current economic and financial crisis where the unemployment rate, especially among young people, has exceeded the 20 mark at EU level and even 30 in some Member States, improving vocational education and training must become a priority for the European Union.
The next item is the report by Mr Klinz, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on credit rating agencies future perspectives.
Still, I would like to take this opportunity to support the call on the United States authorities not to seek the death penalty in the case of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri.
She was telling me about the problems of E coli in fruit and vegetables in the United States and we discussed how this was not common in the European Union.
At the present time, we must not forget young people.
Therefore, the Union must strengthen the ties binding it to its most powerful neighbour by encouraging the facilitation of trade between the two states which itself leads to political convergence and strengthening the assertion of their inherent values.
The increasing complexity that characterises the international system makes it necessary to objectively coordinate the relationships between the Member States, and between the Member States and the EU on the various stages where we interact.
The threat that Member States might have to cancel their current bilateral investment agreements at the Commission's instigation before the EU enters into a new agreement with an equivalent level of protection is unacceptable.
It also acknowledges that negotiations for the accession of Turkey should be intensified and that there should be a continuous commitment to the accession process for the Balkan countries.
The Commission must also abandon its pure control functions relating to the granting of State aid and actively encourage Member States to use it. Why is this important Some countries in the European Union prefer not to mention this facility because it means an additional burden on their domestic budgets.
The European Union itself was born in the ashes of conflicts that remind us how terrible life can be when democracy breaks down.
It would be very interesting from this perspective to see what preventative actions or preventative steps the Office of the High Commissioner has prepared in order to avoid this happening, perhaps in cooperation with the UN or the African Union, on the one hand, and it would be very interesting, of course, to see the method or steps the office would like to take if that does happen, and in the event that North Sudan does not comply with the peace agreement which was signed, and which I basically believe in.
Yesterday, Thursday, 12 May, the European Parliament voted through the resolution on the proposed ILO convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers.
Two weeks later and we have rushed to point the finger and created a credibility problem before we have even established the cause.
We want to believe that the region will avoid the risk of disputes and clashes erupting because of the borders, demographics and migration patterns due to oil and other natural resources, which are plentiful in both countries, statistically poor though they may be.
The economic governance reports on the whole are not, in my view, the best option, but in the situation in which we find ourselves, they are probably the least worst.
The Commission and the G20 countries are asked to establish a new global approach to assessment, which would reduce the likelihood of errors, would regulate the activities of companies involved in ratings and would reduce the risk associated with financial assessment. I welcome and have, on several occasions, repeated the proposal that Europe urgently needs to establish its own credit rating agency, which would produce objective and independent assessments. I welcome the report's call to establish our own independent rating agency, which, according to the proposals, would initially be called the European Credit Rating Foundation.
The European Union must remain firm with regard to the principles and objectives it has set itself; namely, combating global warming as a priority issue and reducing greenhouse gas emissions caused by fossil fuels.
This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour.
It should therefore avoid sending the opposite signal and conducting a contradictory policy.
The Internal Market can be revitalised by encouraging cross-border transactions and I believe that this report will help achieve this objective.
In addition, their parents do not have to give up their professional aspirations because of a lack of childcare support centres.
We are still prepared to work closely with the United States on further measures to close the detention camp.
This blow to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, their political communities, and civilised life in general, isolated these nations and countries for five decades.
Was it the case that there was too little willingness on the part of the Member States to support Frontex accordingly
Economic, social and territorial cohesion policy is one of the fundamental pillars of an EU that is conscious not only to promote and develop excellence by encouraging innovation, but also to create convergence and bridge the gaps of and in less developed areas compared with more advanced ones.
I would immediately stress the importance of including the European Semester in this legislative text, so as to gradually provide an effective platform for joint political discussion of the budgetary policies adopted by all the Member States, which will favour a robust and balanced economic union. I would stress the crucial importance of EU Member States' public finances being in order, as well as the need to adopt increasingly responsible economic policies that ensure stability and growth.
This is why it needs to reform the implementation of its green policy. I should emphasise how important it is to review the mechanisms for monitoring emissions and the need to take them into account within the entire budget.
Any reform made to the approach of European Union policies to forests must not simply be reduced to the challenges posed by climate change, but take into account all the aspects relating to forests' contribution to sustainable development at regional, European and global level.
However, there is a nice link that connects the two issues, because in relation to the migration issue, in particular Schengen, we also see the same principle at work, namely that one of Europe's major successes is now being called into question as a result of national egotism. I am sure that we have all seen the figures indicating that 18 000 refugees have arrived in Italy.
It will reinforce the promotion of high-quality European brands, and will rightly inspire pride in citizens for what Europeans still manage to produce, despite the competition from cheap labour.
Programmes such as 'Youth in Action' and 'Lifelong Learning', which have a very low cost per beneficiary and are extremely effective, should therefore be maintained as a separate element of future multiannual financial frameworks, and these programmes also deserve significantly more funding.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Maritime Safety Authority because, despite the previous absence of a multiannual programme and significant concern over the high number of budget transfers in 2008, the Agency has shown improvements in its management and, taken as a whole, the Court of Auditors had a positive view of the annual accounts and the underlying transactions.
The draft resolution does not, in my opinion, safeguard the necessary security of law in any way whatsoever. I refer, in particular, to the points relating to firstly, the Commission's discretionary powers to withdraw the authorisation to maintain existing agreements or to approve new negotiations to amend current or execute new agreements; secondly, the provision to review the legal framework within five years; and thirdly, the extremely time-consuming procedures for executing new agreements.
We are also looking at how we can strengthen the evaluation of Schengen in order to make sure, beforehand, that the current peer review system, which is not very good, is exchanged for something that is done at a European level, with an increased role for the European Parliament.
It emphasises that humanitarian action should continue to have its own independent financial instrument because emergency aid must be neutral and free of the political choices of the European External Action Service EEAS. With these choices, the European Union remains the most important partner for developing countries in the world and that is vital.
Mr President, I would like to clarify that the committee has asked for this to be deferred because we have been the subject of a procedural violation. A recital that was agreed in a written trialogue procedure - and about which there can therefore be no doubt - was removed in the Coreper Committee of Permanent Representatives text.
They show legislators the possible consequences of their options and help them in making a decision. IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making.
Even some of the payments that appear to be correct are actually supporting grotesque projects.
It is in the EU's interests to promote personal dignity and respect for social rights in all the Member States, creating, for that purpose, a mechanism for finding out who is not offering these rights to their workers and penalising them. I welcome this report and am voting for it. Whilst arguing for the importance of values in a globalising world increasingly dominated by economics, it advocates personal dignity, does not accept the exploitation of individuals, promotes welfare and personal integrated development, and calls on the EU to comply with ILO standards.
Finally, we should also use the summit to reconfirm our political commitment to make progress on crisis management cooperation - provided our decision-making autonomy is in no way affected.
However, it is clear that there must be some measure of control, and I look forward to hearing details of the Commissioner's strategy in due course.
A week ago, the UN General Assembly authorised the EU to speak with one voice at its meetings.
Mr President, the previous speaker mentioned that she is calling for some sort of commission to go to Sri Lanka to look at what is going on on the ground there.
Mr President, Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has set out its priorities in the light of an alarming fact the economic, financial and social crisis is continuing to wreak havoc, with 23 million people currently unemployed, including 5.2 million young people.
Education, vocational training and also the universal idea of 'lifelong learning' are the building blocks for the future of European integration, which is coming up against ever-new challenges in respect of support for the Europe 2020 strategy.
Secondly, if we assume that the outcome of the stress tests will not be a placebo and that the seal of approval will not be handed out randomly, but instead that the tests will be constructive, critical and objective, then I believe that these stress tests will bring many benefits and that the alternative, not carrying out any stress tests, would be a worse solution.
Therefore, the existing programmes should continue to focus on active citizenship and the development of key competences, non-formal education and the promotion of European civil society.
We have now managed to arrive at a balanced result, that is both consumer-friendly and business-friendly.
We cannot permit this state of affairs as Europeans. I cannot understand why you are trying to act like a bigger Catholic than the Pope - I am not sure whether I can say that to a Finn but, there, I have said it anyway
The new food scandal, with the emergence of a new, hyper-toxic bacterium which has already caused dozens of deaths and serious damage to the health of thousands of workers, adds to the long, seemingly endless list of food scandals in the EU. This is, in fact, a crime by international companies, which are poisoning the food chain and sacrificing human life and the health of the workers in order to increase their profits.
We need policies which will cover the steps that young people have to take when making the transition from education to employment. I feel that it is vital for young people and the various youth organisations to be involved in the decision-making process.
Funding cancer research can save people's lives and cut treatment costs. I applaud the political will in support of funding that has already been earmarked for cancer research under the programme.
I voted in favour of this resolution because it calls for the use of the Seventh Framework Programme FP7 to take account of the different consequences in each Member State of the economic crisis for the final years of the programme 2011-2013, given the considerable sums EUR 28.8 billion over three years still to be programmed, the objectives to be achieved for EU 2020 and preparation for a European Research Area and the Innovation Union.
That will benefit everyone in rural areas.
This extension is aimed at addressing the widespread economic crisis, given that terminating trade preferences would compromise these countries' economic recovery, and would have consequences for the whole stabilisation and transition process of the Western Balkans.
The Council has devoted a great deal of attention and energy to this issue, not least through a mutual peer evaluation of the practical application of this instrument which has been carried out in all Member States over a period of three years.
If there is reason to believe that organised crime groups are behind more and more crimes on the Internet, the same investigative measures applied in the detection and prosecution of offline organised crime should be applied, coupled of course with an improved coordination mechanism.
Both the European Union and the United Nations have acquired experience in programmes which have produced real results in Somalia and that work must be continued and increased.
It is for this reason that the Committee on International Trade believes in listening to the Commission, which, we should say, has been providing us with a great deal of information on this subject.
However, we must not forget the need to ensure that domestic jobs - not all of which should be regarded as precarious and undervalued or underpaid - are indeed decent jobs.
I continue to believe that the traceability issue affects the competitiveness of SMEs and - just as my top priority since being appointed as a European Commissioner has been SME policy, so continuing the work of my predecessor - I intend to continue protecting the health of consumers through quality products which will be the only competitive ones on the international market, because the competitiveness of European Union products is measured in terms of quality.
There is a recent report from Europol about organised crime which stated that criminal groups from Albania, Turkey and the former Soviet Union will exploit the opportunities that the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area will bring.
Madam President, Commissioner, basically, I am wondering why you wanted to make that statement.
The main factors which contributed to the failure are double standards and a tendency to think in military terms.
They came to see us in their capacity as Vice-Chairs of the European Systemic Risk Board, and we had the pleasure of hearing, from Mervyn King in particular - it was rather amusing, if you recall last year's negotiations, Commissioner - that the safeguard clauses, which the Member States delighted in adding to the package developed by the Commission, would not prevent them from following the recapitalisation guidelines given by the European Banking Authority EBA.
On the issue of food from cloned animals and their offspring, Parliament was right when it maintained its point of view based on principle.
I therefore ask for the adjournment in order that we can conclude this or leave the door open to concluding it, with a first-reading agreement in July.
It is seeking to replace the Member States, thereby corrupting the spirit of bodies like the United Nations General Assembly, where each country and its people still have the same weight, irrespective of their size.
Four proposals relate to fiscal matters, including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact, while the two new regulations try to identify and resolve macroeconomic imbalances emerging within the EU and the euro area.
We can all see the incredibly sensitive situation in Europe and especially in the eurozone which has required different countries to work together in a way that has never been seen before.
At the moment, this mechanism does not actually fall under the discharge, nor does it fall under the declaration of assurance of the Court of Auditors.
It is also very important for research and development policies to be territorialised so that research is distributed harmoniously in relation to all universities.
Citizens and enterprises also need to have the right to have such rulings enforced effectively.
This sector as a whole has experienced enormous expansion since the first provision of Global Positioning System GPS services from US satellite facilities in 2000.
Mr President, I may have changed my seat here to the ECR Group this week, but I have not changed my perspective on the European Union.
At the same time, however, this instrument will fall into disrepute if European Arrest Warrants are used for, say, stolen bicycles, or merely in order to carry out questioning. I regret to say that we have also found that it is being used when perhaps it has been decided not to execute an arrest warrant because there is evidence to show that it was unjustly issued and this is then not respected by the issuing Member State - resulting in the unfortunate situation in which the citizens concerned are repeatedly arrested whenever they cross a border.
According to statistics compiled by the Centre, 75 million Europeans have already tried cannabis and 14 million Europeans have already tried cocaine at least once.
Those EUR 2 500 million should be used to redress, in so far as is possible, the damage that has been caused.
In view also of the lessons learned from the implementation of the development cooperation instrument ahead of the introduction of the new post-2013 instrument, I believe that Parliament should have the possibility to defend the specificity of the EU's development policy by scrutinising strategic programming decisions on an equal footing with the Council.
Is the Commission happy with the fact that, while in some countries the stress test will cover 85 of the banking sectors, in others it will cover barely more than 50 Now, that is a rather remarkable statistic, and I am curious to hear your explanation of this point.
Despite the success of this vote, given the cross-border implications for the safety and health of European citizens, I regret the minor role that Parliament has been given in nuclear matters as it has only a consultative role in this matter.
When you speak about greening it means different things to different people in different countries, including how it is applied.
The Russia of today should not see this as a political attack, but as an offer of support in engaging with its own history, which, just like the history of the other countries in Europe, is characterised by positive as well as negative times.
Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Executive Director of the SESAR Joint Undertaking discharge in respect of the implementation of its budget for the financial year 2009.
Unfortunately, when the facts are revealed, it turns out that in reality, the enterprise has undertaken to pay a fixed sum for a certain period of time.
The limits set for the stage which has just begun are much stricter than those for the previous stages.
Those who today are raising artificial arguments against Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen area will have on their conscience responsibility for the destruction of the political project which is the European Union, and they will never now escape that responsibility.
Mr President, Commissioner, when, hopefully, the plenary session shortly approves the agreement that we negotiated between the institutions with a large majority, we will be playing our part in a significant moment for the transport sector in Europe, a milestone that could signpost the direction for policy for decades to come.
Thirdly, the programmes in both Greece and Ireland are still in the relatively early stages.
No European citizen voted for this man. I have but one word for a government that rules without democracy, and that word is 'dictatorship'. A bureaucratic dictatorship that wants to subjugate the Greeks and that also wants to call the shots in the Netherlands.
Every country should have the right to focus on the concerns of its citizens, including food security, the environment, reservations about genetic modification and the needs of rural areas, in order to support sustainable agriculture in Europe.
The external dimension of the social policy is aimed at promoting core social standards in third countries in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and to ensure that workers are protected through compliance with international labour standards.
The Commission's valuable proposal of 4 May 2011, by which the Schengen area is made more flexible and concerted in order to allow a more regular management of internal migration flows, heads in this direction.
Problems associated with vocational education and training are becoming a priority for us. People at the start of their professional careers may find that unemployment has a negative effect on their further activity in the labour market.
However, I would also ask you to pass on our thanks to your colleagues, because we had a very intense exchange with many individuals - I should particularly like to mention Mr Ciolos and Mr Hahn - and both were very cooperative.
We are still far from achieving that.
The defects of the Stability and Growth Pact, in both its substance and its enforcement, have been obvious for some time; it is right that efforts are now underway to ensure a lasting settlement that works.
In the same vein, I should like to note the delay - some two years after the fact - in setting up procedures to determine responsibility for the Viareggio disaster.
Opening the borders has been one of the European Union's greatest achievements. I am therefore delighted that Parliament has voted in favour of these two new States joining the Schengen area.
The purpose of our voting strategy was instead to send a clear signal that certain trends in the package for introducing austerity measures that are far too extensive ought to be exchanged for a more balanced approach in the final negotiating rounds.
The independence of impact assessments IAs needs to be guaranteed, above all, because of their importance in the decision-making process.
These weaknesses in budgetary planning do not therefore give us the guarantee of specific value for these four agencies.
One such violation which I have drawn the Council's attention to in a written question concerns the journalist Eynulla Fatullayev, who is still being held in detention, even though a decision was issued by the European Court of Human Rights for him to be released. I pointed this out then and I now urge the removal from the Criminal Code of the provisions concerning defamation, slander and insult Art. 147-148. A recent report about Azerbaijan from Transparency International indicates that the government is not taking measures to combat corruption and that the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed.
As it assumes the EU Presidency, Poland has already found roads to a more fruitful dialogue with Russia, so that we can expect concrete steps to be taken in EU-Russia relations in the coming six months.
Dialogue between Russia and the EU should be extended to all sectors and we should move towards a strategic partnership for our common future. I consider that we have common interests with Russia, which we should utilise constructively in order to reach specific agreements on trade, on energy, in order to move towards a transparent and reliable energy policy, and on facilitating the movement of people between Russia and the EU, by making it easier to obtain a visa.
The Europe 2020 strategy has been agreed, its priorities are clear and its objectives are measurable.
This report acknowledges the existing problems with cohesion policy, beginning with the delayed conclusion of negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework MFF and the legislative package, resulting in the belated implementation of the national strategies and operational programmes.
In Denmark, too, the reasons were of an internal political nature.
Through the amendments tabled, we have called for education and vocational training plans to maintain and develop the expertise and skills required for spent fuel and radioactive waste management. I think that a well-trained workforce and the provision of suitable working conditions help enhance nuclear safety. I do not support the ban on exporting radioactive waste, but I call for all the specific contracts signed between Member States and third countries to comply with Recommendation 2008956Euratom on criteria for the export of radioactive waste and spent fuel to third countries.
For the future, we need a detailed report in this regard in order to significantly increase the speed of the GSM first generation network.
The private sector in the European Union and Canada has also expressed strong support for concluding such a comprehensive agreement, even though a number of challenges still remain, taking into account the lofty ambitions declared during the negotiations.
However, in any case, Commissioner, we have to allow the scientists to do their work they need to investigate the entire traceability system, throughout the food chain, including the handling and distribution of food.
Therefore, this debate is a golden opportunity to give an account of what it has achieved on a number of dossiers, in close cooperation with this House.
Before the introduction of the warrant, the average time taken to extradite a wanted person was one year, whereas in these four years in which the EAW has been applied, it has been shown that approximately 50 of wanted persons agreed to their surrender after about 15 days.
In the era of the globalised economy, the European Union's common commercial policy seems quite natural to us.
The resolution adopted today is a first step towards ensuring that Europe's workers are put in a position to adapt to the requirements of the economy.
In truth, it is essential that we increase our awareness of the fact that we cannot leave these problems for future generations. I welcome the introduction of a financial mechanism to help manage this waste, so as to stop it being dangerous, and the adoption of regulators that are more demanding and prevent the violation of this directive.
We absolutely have to stop the increasing land abandonment, because we need people.
No match can be won by playing alone, however.
The only long-term solution to this problem is for the Greeks to reintroduce the drachma, which could be devalued on its own.
We must focus on reducing the administrative hurdles that all small businesses face and look at ways to get real added value from the Single Market via cooperation on intellectual property rights, a European patent and realising the full potential of the Digital Agenda and, of course, eliminating inconsistencies in existing EU legislation, such as in the field of VAT.
If we want to remain a relevant player in a globalised economy, then we have to ensure greater coordination between economic and budgetary policies, as well as greater coordination between the economic policy and the policy on the competitiveness of Member States.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, as shadow rapporteur of the Youth on the Move report, and in view of the various amendments that have been tabled to the reports on the cultural and creative industries and on early years learning, I should like to share the following thought.
You may remember that, in January when the Commission presented the annual growth survey, a very important topic was the need to reinforce the effective lending capacity of the EFSF.
By supporting the report on the European Urban Agenda and its Future in Cohesion Policy, I am advocating a new approach to urban policy based on close cooperation between operators at the various levels of decision-making EU, national level, urban areas and peripheral urban areas.
It is important that the plan does not founder in an excessive number of initiatives, and get bogged down in mere consultations, and that it really is implemented by 2013.
Today, then, rather than cast doubt on the Commission's efforts to review the security risks of our nuclear power plants, let us try to gather as much objective information about their actual condition as we can.
We will also continue developing action specifically devoted to environment and energy experts within the Enterprise Europe network.
Lowering school dropout rates and reducing poverty can only be achieved by providing all children with a future paving the way to a better life. I wish to remind you of the importance of early years activities, especially foreign languages.
The fact that it is a scarce public resource and its cross-border scale make our intervention as EU legislators worthwhile, but we should not couch this process as a confrontation between the various uses that we could assign frequency bands.
It is about having a trained workforce, which is something that we know we need.
Although I agree with some of the proposals made in the amendment, I do not support the establishment of a common rate of corporate taxation.
I would also like to acknowledge the Hungarian Presidency - which inherited this thorny problem only in the final stage of the procedure - for having made every possible effort to make up for lost time. I thank all the Hungarian Presidency representatives for that. I know they do not deserve any blame at all, which is due instead to the stalemate that occurred within the Council between the different national government positions.
I voted for this report which is driven by the European Union's policy commitment to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the EU.
It also reviewed current forest information systems in Europe.
One of the questions we are asking is What is the Commission doing to further strengthen the particularly successful financial instruments in future for small and medium-sized companies One of these successful instruments is the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme CIP. What will happen to CIP when the common strategic framework for research and innovation is developed What opportunities will there be for small and medium-sized enterprises in this context
We are committed to the freedom of Ukraine to decide in which markets it wishes to be present and where it wishes to operate.
That is the core of the problem, and now we are living out the consequences and we are at a turning point.
The words 'industrial competitiveness' raise expectations.
Therefore, the only effective method of preventing distortions in the market and continuing to control textile imports is still to subject such imports to verification procedures that require indication of the country of origin.
We have said all the time that there are two key issues remaining in order to engage in such a dialogue sound readmission, and reintegration policies in line with the EU standards.
Ever since four MEPs were accused of having accepted money from 'bogus' lobbyists in return for tabling amendments, the institution has been seeking to clarify and reform the rules governing the activity of lobbyists in Parliament. A kind of permanent suspicion has long surrounded MEPs' relationships with interest representatives, hence the creation of a first register of lobbyists in 1996.
The Commission proposal, which is adopted by this report, is aimed at simplifying the customs formalities followed by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Union.
Consistency, credibility and the ambitious Europe 2020 strategy therefore also become decisive and fundamental in guaranteeing the stability we need today within the European Union, as well as with regard to our single currency.
Without hiding for one moment the enormous extent to which the centre left and its longstanding ties with neoliberalism are responsible for this process, it is also inseparable from the conflict between those who have been accepting the need to restructure debts within the euro area and those who are pushing to rush blindly on ahead towards new means of institutionalised and openly colonial intervention.
Public acceptance and understanding are nowadays an integral part of EU policy and form the basis for the EU's functioning.
It is the mantra of the European Commission, after all, to 'think small first', yet I have been raising this issue, as many colleagues have said, for many, many years, and yet no direct action has been taken why not We hear about surveys, information gatherings, and stakeholder meetings.
Public budgets have been cut and, as such, private funding should be mobilised in order to finance the forthcoming Eighth Framework Programme for research. I therefore approve of the rapporteur's proposal to increase the participation of industrial groups and small and medium-sized enterprises.
Foreign operators pay nothing to use our roads but UK diesel duty is as much as 23 pence a litre higher, giving competitors a 15 advantage.
I believe this matter should be taken into consideration at least by Parliament's Bureau, because we cannot allow some of the things we have heard here today to be said on behalf of committees representing so many members of Parliament.
The rapporteur states that 'air agreements with neighbouring countries or significant global partners can deliver substantial benefits to passengers, freight operators and airlines, by means ... of market access'.
This represents an essential starting point for dealing with climate change and environmental degradation, the universality and indivisibility of human rights, poverty reduction and development for all, the consequences of demographic change, migration and international organised crime.
The directive's approach at national level will result in the creation of radioactive landfills across the whole of the European Union.
While relying on existing financial, civilian and military resources, Europe can take even more decisive actions in the event of natural and man-made disasters and be even more involved in averting and managing crises and conflicts, and in establishing a lasting peace in third countries.
In relation to this, it is a policy which requires action to be taken which is provided for in the Treaties, but which also requires this action to take new forms.
The adoption of this report is an important step forward as it lays the foundations for the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development of EGNOS, which should smooth the way for implementation of the Galileo system. I also gave it my vote because it will provide an opportunity to take concrete measures that will facilitate the development of transport in Europe, have a major impact on safety and environmental matters and improve traffic flow conditions for road transport.
The purpose of the report with recommendations on proposed interim measures for the freezing and disclosure of debtors' assets in cross-border cases is for European citizens and businesses to have the right for these decisions to actually be enforced.
It is impossible to accept that MEPs will not be subject to public scrutiny regarding the interests they defend in their role, or the pressure they are subject to or who is putting them under pressure. I therefore very much welcome the introduction of the common register of lobbyists and lobbying organisations.
It is expected that accuracy to 45 centimetres will be possible in the near future. I would congratulate the rapporteur, and I welcome the adoption of this report, which I voted for, as it will allow the EU to increase its market share and enhance Europe's competitiveness in a strategic and growing market.
They continued to claim that they were only expressing an opinion, although they knew very well that their ratings were, in fact, being used as a seal of approval.
Unfortunately, the answer is no, but an increasing number of targeted programmes have been set up to improve the situation, including, for instance, the Danube strategy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, for many companies in the European Union, the continual rise in fuel prices represents an additional burden.
I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, for the report he has submitted. I agree with its assessment of the Commission's proposal, and I would like to make a few observations on the importance of such activities.
The European Commission is a strong supporter of fiscal consolidation as a precondition for sustainable growth, but we are more than ever conscious of the sensitivity of the economic debate now being discussed as the 'relaunch versus austerity' problem, and this was discussed even today in the College.
This is absolutely not about protectionism.
The Commission very much welcomes the valuable input of Parliament and looks forward to continued collaboration with Parliament, Member States and stakeholders from all sectors, with the common aim of protecting the health of citizens throughout the European Union.
That is something that should be made clear to Russia at the summit.
Why try and hide the full level of banks' exposure to sovereign debt, especially when we all know the likely reality
This report, drafted by Mrs Ford, is on the legislative proposal for amending Council Regulation EC No 146797 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure, which is part of the economic governance package, adopted by the Commission on 29 September 2010, seeking to 'anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances' so as to make the EU more robust and sustainable.
Member States should establish appropriate mechanisms of coordination across subsectors of general government, to provide for comprehensive and consistent coverage of all subsectors in fiscal planning, numerical fiscal rules, specific to each country, and in the preparation of budgetary forecasts, and setting up multiannual planning as laid down in the multiannual budgetary framework, in particular.
In November 2010, the working group was able to approve a draft agreement for the establishment of a 'transparency register' which ensures the widest possible participation of all categories of operator, while respecting their different or specific identities.
For these reasons, and for the sake of a better road system in Europe, I voted in favour.
I was surprised by the wish of some political forces in the European Parliament to support former leaders of Ukraine both morally and politically.
Parliament has taken a favourable view of the matter today.
This is, I have to repeat once more, exactly EUR 8.8 billion less than was the ceiling for 2012.
Commissioner, in the meeting that we had on the day before your meeting with the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group ENSREG, my group explained to you what our position on this question was.
Parliament's key demand is the creation of an autonomous structure for carrying out impact assessments within Parliament, with a view to further enhancing the quality of its law making and creating synergies with the possibility of a common mechanism for all EU institutions.
The European Parliament is presenting the European Commission and Council with its vision of the European Union's priorities for the 2014-2020 period for the first time.
Scientists and representatives of political circles were eliminated, and people who were famous for being free thinkers were eliminated too.
The German authorities accepted the Commission proposal to dispatch to Germany experts in epidemiology of food-borne diseases from the Commission, the ECDC and the EFSA.
We want to see respect for fundamental freedoms and genuinely inclusive democratic governments in both North and South Sudan.
Finally, cohesion policy is one of solidarity and redistribution, to enable regions to get up to speed and to catch up. It cannot replace any other strategy like, for instance, Europe 2020, which should have its own funding, separate from the cohesion funding, even if these two policies must naturally be coordinated and harmonised.
The Commission could itself take a more active role in working together with the Member States on cross-border enforcement using existing EU-wide networks to facilitate cooperation between the Member States.
The EU has committed itself to the collective target of spending 0.7 of its Gross National Income GNI on Official Development Assistance ODA by 2015.
This question is What is the role of the Union as an independent body in international policy Over the last few days, I have read articles about Baroness Ashton which have astonished me, because they criticise her absence and her lack of policies.
This specifically applies to the issue of governance, to what we are going to do in terms of shareholder liability - we are working from a long-term perspective - and to what we want to do, as I was saying earlier to Mrs Ferreira, with regard to bank resolution.
Measures such as a European patent and the European professional identity card must be strengthened and applied widely in order to strengthen competitiveness and employment.
It seems to me that a lot of speeches start from the assumption that this is a kind of FTA with all the elements that go with it. For example, the problem of social conditionality, of sustainability as we call it, should not be considered here because this is very clearly a measure that is limited in time.
The idea of making agriculture more scientific, of moving away from productivist industrial farms, is now enshrined in the texts.
On the occasion of this anniversary, I should like to remind the House of the commitment shown by successive German governments to supporting Polish attempts to join the European Union.
How does the Commission intend to develop the next programme, from 2014 on I believe that this subject is of particular interest to many people active in European Union affairs and many of the youngsters in our countries.
This isolation only ended in 1991 when it finally became possible to talk about the watershed in the history of the Baltic nations.
As you all know, the EU headline targets under Europe 2020 include increasing the employment rate to 75, lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty and social exclusion, reducing the proportion of early school-leavers to under 10, and ensuring that at least 40 of the younger generation will have completed a tertiary degree by 2020.
My question to you is very straightforward six months later, has my country filed a request for the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund to be activated, in order to support workers affected by the financial crisis If it has, if you have that information, please tell me if it has been approved.
The restriction on the powers of the constitutional court has already been mentioned, and on behalf of our group, I would also like to mention the discriminatory nature of the constitution in relation to members of sexual minorities, as it fails to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.
Neither is it a country which enjoys an independent judiciary.
However, bilateral safeguard clauses are also important in this agreement. I am thinking of sensitive economic sectors such as the automotive, electronics, aerospace and mechanical engineering industries. I am certain that Japan can and will be a fair and reliable partner.
My second example relates to Eurobonds.
Another report that seems very important to me is Youth on the Move, one of the main aims of which is to address early school leaving. I believe that this issue is absolutely connected to youth unemployment, with the very high percentage of unemployment that we have in our Union.
Today, the European Parliament has made its voice heard, by adopting a regulation capable of safeguarding the excellence of the European textile industry.
From the Lithuanian border, it will be possible to see the chimneys of one of these power plants just as clearly as we can we the tower of Strasbourg Cathedral from Parliament.
Children must be fully considered real, active citizens who are able to form and express their own opinions, enjoy certain rights, and who possess their own creative potential.
We heard on the one hand from the Council that, if a European Arrest Warrant is executed properly and effectively and not in the many trivial cases we have seen, its advantages outweigh those disadvantages.
Madam President, better and less expensive data transmission through high-speed broadband for all in 2020 that is an ambitious policy target, I must say, and I fully support it. But let us face it it will not come easily.
We should put more pressure on the Egyptian authorities to defend the Coptic Christians.
Early childhood care and education are made available in different ways throughout the European Union, with different definitions of 'quality', which depend significantly on the cultural values of each country and region, and on their interpretation of 'childhood'. Early childhood learning is the basis for successful lifelong learning, which is central to achieving the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy. I therefore voted in favour of the report on early childhood learning which sets out common EU objectives in pursuing the aims of the Barcelona European Council specifically, that, by 2010, the provision of childcare should be ensured for at least 90 of children between three years old and the mandatory school age, and for 33 of children under the age of three.
I voted in favour of this report. I was keen in particular that we should ensure effective monitoring of the trends of imports of products covered by this Regulation as far in advance as possible and establish customs surveillance on these imports. I am also in favour of the idea that a quarterly report should be submitted on the application and implementation of the monitoring.
However, we do think that there is a need for a fundamental appraisal of cohesion policy going forward because, as more and more regions go above the 75 threshold, the policy is either going to become redundant or be reformed, and that is what we expect to happen.
I believe that the Directive will establish a legal framework in the European Union for the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste, and will form an integral part of EU legislation, ensuring the safe use of nuclear energy in those Member States which retain it in their energy mix.
The disparities between European regions have evolved over long periods of time. I support the report's proposal that, in order to reduce these inequalities and streamline the European integration process for all Member States, we need to reduce the period required for funding approval and cut red tape and all the rules and procedures along with it, which needlessly hinder rather than help the European Union's cohesion policy.
The new Parliamentary powers established by the Treaty bring with them new responsibilities to ensure that Parliament and its responsible committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent.
Now these rules, rules that you are basically refusing to question, are the free international movement of capital, the financialisation of the economy, an over-emphasis on the short term, securitisation, complex financial products that are not based on any concrete wealth creation and the constitution of large multinational groups which are more powerful than States and are not subject to control.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
The decision concerning the so-called transparency register is not ambitious enough.
In order to produce a modern budget for the future, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has highlighted some important issues for future work on the budget.
What is more, this is a city that makes it abundantly clear how badly Europe failed and how important it is to act together.
The price per barrel has increased by 63 since 2007; it is true that it has decreased today, but I do not think it has fallen enough to be sustainable.
Since the Schengen Agreement was concluded in 1985, its five founding states have expanded to 25, 22 of which are European Union Member States.
Secondly, is the European public debt crisis deteriorating before our very eyes, as Mr Giegold describes This deterioration will only be tested in the banks' trading books in the current stress tests.
In view of this, and considering the importance of the issue of legitimacy and informing citizens for the effectiveness and proper functioning of European policies, I voted for the draft agreement on the establishment of a common transparency register.
Madam President, this discussion highlights the pivotal role of the ILO in the world of labour. I believe that we have to continue our close cooperation with the ILO because its work in this field, and in others of course, applies very much to the European context.
For that reason, barriers that are still in place need to be removed and procedures simplified, while existing programmes need to be expanded and promoted.
As stressed in the report, the EU is Canada's second most important trade partner.
This infighting is responsible for the risk of a new, even bloodier war, now that NATO, the USA and the European Union are directly involved, which is what the Euro-unifying forces seem to be seeking after the war in Libya.
However, the Americans may find that Syria is a hard nut to crack.
That brings me to the partnerships which will provide a framework for aligning instruments and resources, bringing all the key actors together.
The new Eurovignette Directive, which is intended to encourage the implementation of harmonised charging systems in the Member States in order to improve the efficiency and environmental performance of heavy goods vehicles, will end up penalising certain peripheral Member States, such as Italy, which are countries of departure or destination of goods.
It offers many opportunities for students' intellectual emancipation, for combating early school leaving, unemployment and poverty, as well as for the development of international cooperation in higher education but also in vocational education and training.
It therefore needs urgent repair before it is extended.
National cofinancing continues to be an obstacle to accessing funds, particularly for countries with weaker economies, which continue to see many millions of euro returned to the countries that benefit most from the main EU policies, specifically the Economic and Monetary Union and the internal market.
They made every effort to control the fire.
This is worrying in view of the fact that we probably have several difficult decisions ahead of us, including with regard to the situation in Greece, and there is a risk that at some stage, we will find ourselves up against a wall.
Parliament ought to have a more in-depth debate on these issues, which is why I would like to provide more room for the discharge debate. I also have a positive view of the principle that the European Parliament should have a common air miles system to provide the benefit of cheaper air travel.
The legislative proposal codifies the existing texts and creates a legislative act which is easier to understand and more accessible.
Funding for programmes such as Lifelong Learning Erasmus, Leonardo da Vinci, Comenius, Grundtvig, Marie Curie, Erasmus Mundus and Youth in Action must increase.
Mrs Vassiliou, the chords played by that violin in Sarajevo, the one Mrs Pack told us about, resonate more with our Europe than with a multitude of regulations.
As regards the issue of human rights, women's rights and political pluralism, polygamy still exists, even in the South.
The Schengen area will be one of the issues discussed at the Council's forthcoming meeting.
It is beyond the competence of the EU to dictate educational reforms to Member States, and we must ensure that this is respected.
It does, however, also give rise to costs - infrastructure costs, but also other costs such as fine particulates in the air, noise, traffic jams and so on.
I am glad that the European Parliament has endorsed that proposal in Mr Dess's report.
The SBA calls on the Member States to improve the business environment for SMEs, so its principles should be duly implemented and adopted.
What I am particularly pleased about is the fact that we are opening the door to modern technologies, that we are not sticking with simple old-fashioned textile labels in textile products and that we are actually going to look into the possibility of using modern technologies in order to provide the consumer with the best possible information.
The proposed scenario of a 30 reduction will have a huge impact on sectors participating in the ETS, and will force them to step up measures to a significantly greater extent than those sectors not participating in the scheme.
Initial signs of its success can already be seen in the fact that real GDP grew by 6.3 in 2010, providing evidence of a revival of the economy.
On the other hand, efficient use of resources as a measure on its own is not enough - in general, there needs to be a sustainable attitude to the environment at every stage of business development. I therefore call on both the European Commission and the Member States to pay as much attention as possible to developing greater youth entrepreneurship and promoting efficient use of resources and other energy saving initiatives.
With this resolution, the European Parliament reaffirms its prerogatives key player and holder of the function of management and budgetary control of European civilian and military missions.
We should not believe that we can get away with simply bashing Belarus, because there are severe problems in Azerbaijan and in several other Eastern Partnership countries, and I hope that the forthcoming study commissioned by the Subcommittee on Human Rights will give some guidance on how we should talk to these countries about their human rights situation.
We have a duty to heal Europe's public finances and we have a duty to set out responses, which have to begin with the involvement of businesses and the world of work, and have different and more open rules in order to complete the single market and be in a better position to compete on the global market.
As regards Russia itself, the new paradigm is what is known as the Partnership for Modernisation.
In this respect, it will be essential to achieve the full engagement of public and local authorities. A fundamental objective of innovation is to maintain a high level of prosperity in Europe. I hope the joining of forces which has been proposed will contribute to support for the process of innovation and help bring about economic stabilisation.
The Early Warning and Response System and the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed have provided a solid basis for exchanging information.
It is founded on Article 2071 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU, which provides for the exclusive competence of the EU in matters of foreign direct investment as part of the common commercial policy.
This situation, where we have no influence over the safety of nuclear power stations, cannot continue.
What has happened is totally unacceptable and we have been fobbed off with spurious pretexts.
The proposals which the Commission announced on Wednesday to tighten the asylum and migration policy contain one piece of poppycock and some good initiatives.
The future approach should therefore be based on a common strategic framework for the various Structural Funds, in order to ensure a common perspective and to optimise the synergies which can be established between the different funds.
The main challenge for the international activities of the GNSS Programmes will be to ensure the compatibility and interoperability with Galileo, to access global GNSS-related resources and set worldwide standards, to ensure security of the space segment and network of ground stations, while ensuring a stricter control of sensitive GNSS technologies developed with European funding, and to join in an international effort to develop innovative applications and specialised applications of supra-regional interest.
So I would urge the Commission that we should have a much tighter timeframe.
Like many of my fellow Members, Commissioner, I was informed by the press that the European Commission is planning to drastically cut funding for the Most Deprived Persons MDP programme.
However, for formal reasons, we must ensure that those businesses which are affected are involved in an appropriate way and, therefore, we need the time to do this.
With this resolution, the European Parliament appeals to the EU and Russia to step up negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement and calls for Russia to implement all previous signed agreements and to solve the problem of non-citizens in Russia. I think that, firstly, Europe has to solve the problem of non-citizens in the Latvian Republic and only then make recommendations on this issue.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction as it has managed its resources prudently and in line with expectations.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer my contribution by stating the need for a new methodological approach, particularly in the heritage and cultural heritage sector, linked to the intelligent use of new technology.
The response of the British authorities was that an exemption applies in the case of Sellafield because power is no longer being generated there.
I also supported the raising of the retirement age for MEPs from 60 to 63. I feel that representatives enforcing a slashing of living standards for workers should at the very least accept that their privileges undergo the same treatment.
This should examine, in particular, consumer views with regard to the amount of information that should be supplied on the label of textile products, and investigate which means other than labelling may be used to provide additional information to consumers.
This phenomenon is of great significance and has repercussions on the daily lives of many of our citizens, exacerbating the insecurity they face.
In conclusion, I believe that this report marks a first step in the development of this sector.
Unfortunately these reports do not always receive the political attention they deserve, even though they are of great importance when reflecting on, changing and adapting programmes and projects because they can result in a more efficient use of human and budgetary resources.
I am in favour of this own-initiative report since it deals with promoting corporate social responsibility as a voluntary motivational tool designed to stimulate business growth.
After 20 years, even Mr Medvedev had to admit that one cannot ignore the terrible and criminal heritage of Russian power. I recall the words of our colleague, Mr Swoboda, who yesterday asked for a full clearing up of Russian history, especially the atrocities of the Stalin era.
Representatives of the European Union will be able to speak at the General Assembly and submit amendments agreed by the Member States of the EU. This is a joint achievement of the Member States, the Commission and Council, but also of the European Parliament.
In addition, no decisions have yet been taken regarding the headquarters in Belgium, which makes it significantly more difficult for the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking to function efficiently.
Once more, welcome to Brussels and to our Parliament.
While respect must be shown for the reversibility principle, concepts and technical solutions for final disposal should be envisaged in order to enable potential access to and recovery of waste for technical reasons or if progress in research allows the emergence of new technological solutions such as transmutation. I agree with the proposal's aim of ensuring that adequate financial resources are set aside to meet the requirements of nuclear plant decommissioning, and that the waste is managed in a transparent manner.
Mr Yanukovych, your behaviour in these cases is the litmus test of your credibility and your determination to introduce European values into Ukraine.
Secondly, a preparatory action which allows the Commission to finance pilot projects aimed at selecting, training and deploying a limited number of volunteers in view of the adoption of a legislative proposal.
As the rapporteur - who subscribes to this - points out, 'labour standards should not be used for protectionist trade purposes' according to the international bodies So then, what principles, what values, what considerations could ever challenge the absolute power of the market You talk a lot about the social responsibility of companies who, after all, are only playing by the rules that you have put in place.
the oral question to the Commission on the Small Business Act SBA review by Bendt Bendtsen, on behalf of the PPE Group, Edit Herczog, on behalf of the SD Group, Fiona Hall, on behalf of the ALDE Group, Reinhard Butikofer, on behalf of the VertsALE Group, Giles Chichester, on behalf of the ECR Group, and Niki Tzavela, on behalf of the EFD Group - B7-03022011.
Unfortunately, Mr Osman's prize was not enough to stamp the international community with the desirable sense of urgency for confronting the repeated and serious human rights violations recorded in Sudan. I hope that, before and after separation, both parties can respect what has been agreed, build two peaceful countries, pull their populations out of poverty and promote good neighbourliness; and that the European Union may be able to contribute to that.
I voted to give discharge to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and take the view that the Centre's powers must be strengthened so that the Union has an independent capacity to assess the severity of the risk of infection should a pandemic occur, and so that coordination between the Member States can be improved.
I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons.
Mr President, the most fundamental weakness of the proposed stress tests has now been referred to. It is the possibility of widespread sovereignty faults.
Madam President, if Members look at their e-mails and all the requests from lobbyists and industry, and the pros and cons on the climate, they can conclude that climate is very clearly back on the political agenda.
Therefore, after deducting the amount currently requested from the available appropriations, EUR 489 628 679 of the EUR 500 million maximum remains available until the end of 2011.
The second is the need to ensure that adequate financial resources are set aside to meet the requirements of nuclear plant decommissioning and that the resultant waste is disposed of. The third concerns the development of regional disposal facilities, while the fourth deals with transparency and participation of the public.
We ought to avoid the same errors of conception and implementation.
This report on 'unlocking the potential of cultural and creative industries' CCIs is based on the European Commission Green Paper on the same topic and I voted for it, as it is official recognition of the economic and social importance of this sector.
Instead, we believe that the EU should have demanded improvements in these areas that could have been implemented quickly, particularly in view of the fact that these demands will be made if a trade agreement between the EU and Pakistan should be entered into at a later date.
Written explanations of vote
I am convinced that the European Union needs harmonised guidelines which enable Member States to make charges for external costs created by the road transport sector.
There were socialist governments everywhere that these budgetary and financial problems have arisen.
Does the Commission think that the proposed cuts in next year's budget will have a negative impact on the amounts allocated to education, training and boosting employment in the EU in general
I have voted in favour of granting budgetary discharge to the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union for 2009 because in this report I have found high precision, great transparency and a notable orientation towards results.
In the face of this new reality, political decision makers are charged both with taking preventive action and with responding effectively to new developments.
the report by Carlo Casini, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the amendment of Parliament's Rules of Procedure following the establishment by the European Parliament and the Commission of a joint transparency register.
Thankfully, the EP and the Commission see that we are being unjustly and unfairly treated.
The report sufficiently highlights innovation, which constitutes a necessary means of helping respond to many of the problems and challenges facing humanity today.
Although the EU has set ambitious targets in its emblematic initiative entitled 'Digital Agenda', such as broadband cover for all EU citizens by 2013, with speeds of 30 Mbps or more by 2020, it is still lagging behind the USA and Japan in terms of competitiveness.
That is laudable, because when I hear the representative of the European Council say 'We have not discussed this in the Council', and when I hear Commissioner Reding say 'A country's constitution is up to that country alone and it is not for us, at European level, to interfere with that', then I am glad that we in the European Parliament are, indeed, having this debate amongst ourselves.
Less polluting vehicles will remain exempt. I voted against this report's proposal as I believe it will harm the outlying Member States.
The European Council, Parliament and Commission cannot ignore these violations of European values, because this may set a negative precedent for other illiberal regimes to follow.
The proposals which the Commission has put on the table for this purpose are the proportionality test, where we have to look at the seriousness of the offence, the length of the sentence which this offence would carry, and the costbenefit of executing such an arrest warrant.
I welcome the creation and development of the Small Business Act SBA, which, in my opinion, provides timely solutions for the main obstacles encountered by small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs as regards expanding their activities and becoming established.
You might argue that you want more, I myself would have liked to go further, but I do fully appreciate the efforts that Commissioner Rehn is willing to make.
For our part, we will continue to advocate making full use of these funds and making them complement each other, in order to defend and promote production in each country, making use of their potential for combating unemployment and promoting jobs with rights, to create wealth and distribute it better, to advocate quality public services, to combat poverty, and to defend small-scale coastal fishing, family-run farms and small and medium-sized farmers.
Indeed, improving infrastructure does not always go hand-in-hand with major development. A rigorous assessment of all projects underway is therefore urgently needed, along with a strategic redirection of the funds that are still available, taking into account the achievement of the objectives set out by the Europe 2020 strategy in preparation for the next Multiannual Financial Framework MFF. I support the recommendations in this report aimed at creating synergies through the establishment of a strategic instrument that covers all the Structural Funds and is geared towards innovation and technological development, supporting companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, and reducing administrative costs.
How can we get an overall picture at European Union level, when only 19 countries have provided the basic indicators needed for the purposes of comparison Although we have asked the Commission to improve the consistency and quality of the information obtained, there is a transparency vacuum, a lack of available data.
This is one of the key structural causes of unemployment in the European Union, and we need the contribution of these agencies more than ever.
To begin with, I should like to draw attention to the importance of providing consumers with information that is precise and relevant, but above all comprehensible and uniform, regarding the components of textile products exhaustive information is useless if the public is then unable to decipher it. We have achieved a step forward that is necessary but not enough we must make further progress and protect the most vulnerable members of the public.
This is a way of strengthening the European dimension of the system so that individual Member States do not feel pressured into acting unilaterally. I will be looking for clear backing for this approach from the European Council, so that detailed Commission proposals can be finalised and have an opportunity to succeed.
We are pushing, by all means, for ratification by the end of the year, the tenth anniversary, because it would prove an important commitment by all Member States to fighting these crimes.
If you push a law through the Hungarian Parliament and decree that, from now on, it may only be amended with a two-thirds majority, you know that it is not going be easy to amend it again after the next election.
The information from the current financial framework illustrates that, instead of being used to satisfy grassroots needs, the funds available under the euro-unifying budget are being directed against them, in order to support the profitability of the monopoly groups.
It is worth pointing out that the definition of domestic workers in the draft ILO Convention is very wide.
We do require that food provided to people in any circumstance is the most appropriate for the particular circumstances.
To this end, we must invest in care and education from the earliest childhood, and monitor the services provided and the proficiency of providers.
In the area of domestic work, I believe that the ILO offers us an excellent opportunity for shedding light on the operation of some of our labour markets, since domestic work is too often precarious work, undervalued and undeclared. I will tell you quite simply. I understand that some of you have expressed concern about the recognition or regularisation of illegal migrants, but I am also concerned with the battle we have to fight in each Member State against undeclared work.
The free movement of workers is a fundamental principle of the EU. Together with the free movement of goods, services, and capital, it is a pillar of the Single Market and has contributed to European integration over the last 50 years.
Obtaining planning permission is one of the greatest problems faced by investors in Lithuania.
Finally, I would like to offer my resolute support to Mrs Pack for choosing Sarajevo as European capital of culture.
As can already be seen from the examples of Greece, Portugal and Spain, it establishes a radical austerity policy which has consequences that are hard to predict for the future of the European project as a whole.
The purpose of the present proposal is to extend the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the cross-border transportation of euro cash by road between euro area Member States the main proposal to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro, since there is normally an increased need for euro cash transportation in the run-up to the changeover. I welcome this extension of the scope although it should be noted that the legal basis here is Article 352 TFEU, which means that Parliament merely has the power of consent.
This issue has been current in the European Parliament since 1989, which led the Commission to draw up an action plan in 2003.
It offers a solution in regions where unemployment among young people is high, given the labour shortages in certain sectors in some Member States that are evident from the Commission's new quarterly vacancy monitor.
We have done an excellent job in creating a macroeconomic surveillance procedure, which is something new and which complements the work that is done to keep the common currency afloat.
It has refused to send us the relevant material, it has refused to answer our questions and it has refused to meet the Committee on Budgetary Control for an open debate, as all the other institutions do.
Mr President, we are looking at a package that has had last-minute changes made to it by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council, which have not yet been translated into the various languages.
It also proved possible to honour Parliament's explicit requests for further investigation into the use of language-independent symbols on clothing labels and into possible links between allergic reactions and chemical substances used in textiles.
The increase in fuel prices translates directly into a fall in fishermen's profits, as the fishermen's boats are driven by diesel engines.
I have condemned that violence and called for an inquiry - an inquiry that has to be as thorough as it is independent and that should tell us exactly what happened.
The application of reverse qualified majority voting is expanded to the recommendation on prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances.
I voted in favour of this report because I agree with its underlying spirit to simplify and harmonise EU legislation on imports of textile products in order to facilitate trade with third countries. I believe, in fact, that the limited trade policy measures applied by the EU in the textiles sector can be managed entirely without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports.
Since the beginning of our Presidency, we have dedicated all our energy and have been tireless in our efforts in promoting the common European agenda. I am especially pleased that not even the critics, who were mentioned during today's debate, have questioned the firmness and the sincerity of my government's commitment.
The resolution denounces the exceedingly high number of scams carried out to the detriment of thousands of small businesses across the entire European Union and highlights the defective transposition by Member States of the 2006 directive on misleading advertising.
You have rightly said that several countries were not prepared to take part in a European inspection procedure.
These targets are ambitious, given that the current situation is so unstable and forces young people to live in a perpetual state of uncertainty, far removed from the encouraging prospect of a stable job in the future and of their place in society.
Therefore, also in view of more effective controls, I join in the request made to the Joint Undertaking to include in its Financial Rules a specific reference to the powers of the Internal Audit Service of the Commission as its internal auditor.
We will be voting on the report tomorrow.
Since this country is on one of the main drug smuggling routes into the European Union, I consider it important to have factual, objective information from Croatia on these problems. I therefore find the rapporteur's position entirely acceptable and I support this recommendation.
The new legislation stipulates what kind of information the purchaser must receive from the seller, the delivery terms and the rules applied when the risk lies with the purchaser, not to mention the latter's right to cancel or refuse purchases or the right to have an item repaired or replaced.
We do not know at what time the alarm will sound, but we should familiarise ourselves with the instructions and act on them when the alarm is sounded.
We could say that this is just a drop in the ocean, but I believe - and I am happy that this has been acknowledged by many during the debate - that we have made an extremely important first step towards internalising costs and re-circulating revenues into the sector, even if, as with every compromise, it is not the most perfect one, and I am certain that we will be able to take further steps in the following years.
Aware of the consequences of the Lisbon Treaty, we realised that close cooperation with the European Parliament and its members would be essential for the success of any Presidency in the future.
Whilst today's vote could have gone much further, I welcome colleagues' decision to reject the dumping of nuclear waste in third countries.
The real question is whether all EU citizens, irrespective of their national origin, are to be treated equally and granted equal access to EU fundamental rights.
Although some issues remain unresolved, such as the negative impact on biodiversity of tar sands extraction and of some seal-derived products, I voted in favour not only because the public procurement problem has practically been resolved, but also because of the benefits to the Member States, and to prevent the negotiations from suffering any delays.
It is completely unacceptable that there is no control over cloning techniques or over the food resulting from these techniques, which could be intended for human consumption.
The basic condition for the Council to decide in favour of abolishing checks on internal borders with these Member States is to confirm, within the framework of the assessment procedures, whether the new Member States have fulfilled the necessary condition of applying all parts of the Schengen acquis data protection, the Schengen Information System SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, police cooperation and visas.
Furthermore, satellite navigation systems must provide interoperability with different systems, including traditional systems.
The proposed coordination may help ensure the more efficient use of resources, especially at a time when budget cuts are being made, particularly in the cultural sector.
We must not even speak of it today, in this resolution I regret this most sincerely and I do not think that this is how we will promote respect for human rights in the world.
As such, I believe in the power that certain cultural initiatives can have on relations within the Union, as well as diplomatic relations with third countries.
There is a lack of information when it comes to chemicals and various products used in textile manufacture.
I would therefore like to ask you, Commissioner, if it is possible that, without any increase in the Union budget, the creation of the infrastructure fund and new innovation policies - which will be linked to cohesion and to regional development, which I support - will become a Trojan horse brought into the cohesion budget
I firmly believe that professional education and training should be available and affordable on a lifelong basis, regardless of a person's position on the labour market or their income.
Indeed, it is because Bashar al-Assad has crossed the red line that Hamas suddenly no longer feels at ease in Damascus and is considering moves to Qatar and Cairo, and that it wanted to hold last-minute negotiations when it had been negotiating for ages.
We should also not forget these factors, including when it comes to the idea in the proposal of earmarking the revenue from infrastructure charges.
More than a year ago already, the European Parliament clearly expressed its support for the idea of a democratic process which could lead to elections.
Just as Mr Barnier said, it is all about confidence.
You now have in your hands a means of exerting pressure not just on the Member States, but also on your own administration - which has until now been a little lax in dealing with these matters.
If all the Member States who use the euro want to strengthen and deepen the coordination of their economic policies, then that should be their decision.
Yet I see that Mr Becsey is with us, who has served his time in this Chamber, and who I think will be able to convince the Council that Parliament is the only democratically and directly elected body in respect of which the Council has a reporting obligation.
So, Baroness Ashton, what diplomatic options do you have in mind in order to avoid such a disaster
Implementation of cohesion policy from 2007-2013 deserves to have Parliament's attention for several important reasons, which are as follows systematic growth of cohesion is strategically important for the future of the Union; the Cohesion Fund is an opportunity for the new Member States and for regions subject to particularly difficult conditions of development; reservations concerning implementation of policy have been expressed in recent years by the Committee on Budgetary Control because of the rate of error, which is too high.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work because I think that, despite some inconsistencies identified by the Court of Auditors in the management of some funds and irregularities with respect to a procurement procedure, it can be said that the management on the whole has been good.
The directive was an ambitious European project and, at the time, the Commission was concerned that the whole proposal would be sabotaged and that there would be no directive at all if it had insisted on extending the directive beyond the relationship between fraudsters and citizens.
After all, it is the task of the Council and Parliament as the two colegislators to find a solution which satisfies the needs and expectations of European citizens through joint efforts.
Having noted, and I quote and now utter the following euphemism - 'a lack of values and ethics in the behaviour of certain actors in the financial markets and institutions' - this Parliament has set off on a pathetic crusade to inject some ethics into the sector.
As several speakers have said, tomorrow's vote is a very important one, and I believe that it will go well. I hope that, at the end of this week and through the following week, the European Council will be able to have a serious discussion about what we can do to reach an agreement.
I also sense that there is broad support - maybe not full but broad support - for Mrs Lagarde, who has already been endorsed by the EU Member States and by the Commission as their candidate for Managing Director of the IMF.
We should also be aware that derogations are proposed for two types of situation in the case of difficulties with neighbouring countries and in the case of circumstances that no one could have foreseen. I believe, however, that we have to take the line that time is not on our side and that derogations should not be misused.
We are delighted that Parliament gave such strong support on 11 November 2010 to the concept of the innovation partnerships.
Having said this, the European Central Bank's credibility relies on the absolute determination of the euro area governments to do whatever it takes to ensure the financial stability of the euro area, so I have no doubts about the system's ability, of the efforts in the euro area and the credibility of the European Central Bank. I have no doubts about the capacity of the European Central Bank to defend European interests, nor about the commitment of the Member States of the euro area to provide all the guarantees the European Central Bank needs to fulfil its independent role as our central bank.
Mr President, having been listening to this debate, the speech I am about to make goes against the grain.
There are many reasons for developing new standards in the area of domestic work.
The questions from the left side of this House in particular deal directly with the concerns of the people in Europe, but also in India, and these are concerns for their own social and economic situation and the prospects of workers and those looking for work, including in the EU Member States.
However, with regard to this matter, we must always take into account the performance level that we want to see in the future, on the one hand, for the first generation network and, on the other, for the cable operators and everyone else with an interest in the spectrum, particularly the blue light organisations.
Madam President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that I trust in his sincere efforts to fight nuclear disasters and I trust his sensitivity and objectivity in providing Europe with a safety net against nuclear disasters.
While basically welcoming the project, I believe that it would be worth fully re-evaluating this aspect, weighing it up again and only then adopting it.
At the same time, we wish to repudiate statements or suggestions alleging that either the Council or the Hungarian Presidency acted dishonestly or in bad faith, or was under the influence of interest groups.
Mr Mitchell, it is not the Bureau, it is a matter for the Conference of Presidents, but no doubt the Swoboda reforms will make proposals on how to deal with this. I agree with you.
Democracy is about being able to say bye-bye as well as hello, and that is important knowing that you have the right to use your ballot box, once, twice, three times, four times to change your government, to demand of your government, is critical, and you can only do that when democracy is deep and flourishing.
In view of the fact that women account for only 30 of European researchers and only 13 of directors of European research institutions, I would highlight the need for the 'Innovation Union' initiative to take account of future guidelines as regards a more balanced representation of women and men in scientific disciplines. I would also call for such guidelines to be implemented effectively by the Member States.
In the light of these developments, and against this constitutional background, and in keeping with their commitment to transparency, Parliament and the Commission have agreed to establish and maintain a common register in order to keep a list of the names of and exercise scrutiny over the organisations and individuals who take part in the drafting and implementation of EU policies.
To answer the questions in a very direct way yes, the funding is there; yes, the Member States can use it; and, yes, the Member States can give from their own resources to this de minimis ceiling.
They are mentioned in relation to nuclear power stations; they are mentioned in relation to banks.
the report by Mr Albertini, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy CFSP in 2009, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006,
It is to the credit of the negotiating team and, specifically, of the shadow rapporteurs who, together with myself, Council staff and the Commission, reached this fragile equilibrium.
With regard to surveillance missions, I have serious reservations concerning the proposal for such missions, since they will be composed mainly of European Commission officials and will have significant powers entrusted to them, without the members of these missions having any political mandate.
What these people have railed against is the EU obsession of creating a European federal state, ignoring the will of the people and democracy.
For this reason, the full implementation of the policy for small and medium-sized enterprises and, in particular, the Small Business Act, is a high priority task for the Hungarian Presidency.
It is important to provide storage in both interim storage facilities and long-term repositories in accordance with these standards.
Our call for a seven-year financial perspective which is expressed in a structure that reflects the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, while, at the same time, respecting all the policies for the European Union and avoiding increasing the European budget to unrealistic levels, must be seen to be reasonable.
The inclusion of the European Development Fund EDF in the budget would be significant progress as long as it does not lead to a reduction in total funding amounts at EU level. I am also in favour of 'more' budgetary aid, whether general or sector-specific, and fewer projects whenever the macro-economic and governance criteria allow.
European consumers have the right to know what they are buying.
The presence of animal-derived materials should be clearly indicated, so as to prevent consumers or individuals who suffer allergies from running the risk of inadvertently purchasing real fur products when they would prefer not to do so.
In that event, what we would be discussing now is not whether we want the number one position or the number three position, but whether we want to avoid the last position.
There are many forces that wish to keep it precisely as it has been for the last 50 years. I have to say that even if you admire our political capability to get proposals through, please do not exaggerate it. For my part, I admire your rhetorical skills.
I think that the economic sanctions must be extended against Belarus, applying to the state firms in this country which play an important role in shaping the region.
The companies we have heard of exist solely to swindle unsuspecting and sometimes over-stretched organisations, and I find that particularly outrageous when they are damaging community enterprises, often with limited budgets.
On the other hand, however, that strategy should not result in indiscriminate interference by the EU central authority in the economies of individual Member States.
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, credit rating agencies certainly did not cause the global financial crisis, but, in my opinion, they were responsible to a significant extent for its severity.
The Commission has therefore presented this communication.
Commissioner, I would suggest that you take some of these free days and reallocate them to the implementation of the budget, so that we can actually achieve the political goals we want to achieve. I would ask that we should also be provided with an EU 2020 strategy for the administration of the EU. This would require action not only from you, but also from the entire college and the President of the Commission.
In fact, in the short term the new regulation provides a comprehensive review clause which invites the Commission to set out, where necessary, further labelling requirements in this area.
Make the system fairer and more transparent, and then we can talk about own resources.
While there is much to admire in this report, let us be honest with ourselves and with our voters.
On the other hand, a prior full assessment of the impact of the measures proposed has not been conducted by the Commission. I think that it would have had a major impact, in particular, on Pakistan's population and this country's budget resources.
However, I think that this optional instrument deserves a try as it may get rid of some of the administrative burden which is currently preventing SMEs from expanding their businesses in Member States other than their own.
The figures are frightening the Baltic States, Ireland, Greece and Slovakia, 30; Spain, 40; in your own country, Mr President, one million people under 25 with no prospects of a job.
It is precisely in such times of crisis that you also learn to better seek each other out, and we experienced just how crucial the role and the expertise of the IMF are, even for us here in Europe.
Since I agree with the rapporteur's position, I voted for her report, but I believe that the proposal can, and must, be improved by tabling a strategy that is more comprehensive and gradual.
This year, the mandate for the budget is even more important than it might have been in previous years, given that in 2012 we are going to be negotiating the next financial perspective.
The agency's procurement procedures and criteria for recruiting staff have also attracted criticism.
We know that Malta, Italy and France have been subjected to this pressure, but we have to be very clear that the Council must do its part by completing the asylum package, completing the immigration package, completing the reform of the Frontex Regulation and, not least, by updating the solidarity clause included in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which means updating Directive 200155EC.
According to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, the EU is formally committed to effective multilateralism, which has a powerful UN organisation as its focal point, making a vital contribution to tackling the global challenges.
Therefore, I am absolutely convinced that the adoption of a common transparency register will represent a major further step forward in enhancing transparency in the EU decision-making process and providing a direct response to citizens' concerns.
Some important issues are acknowledged in the report's preamble, such as the link between a poor and disadvantaged background and low educational achievement, or the major difficulties many households have in reconciling family obligations with deregulated working hours and insecure jobs.
Making it possible for associations, for enterprises, especially micro-enterprises in the form of clusters, and for national or regional networks of technological platforms to participate in a future framework programme is an essential task.
Recent developments in the area are raising concerns as regards compliance with the terms of the recent referendum on the independence of South Sudan, while the escalation of violence in Abyei, which is threatening to cause general destabilisation in the area, is a negative development.
On the remaining one, there is a disagreement between Parliament and the Council. I believe a solution can and must be found.
For this reason, I hope that tomorrow's vote will show that the compromise that has been sought is supported by Parliament.
Commissioner, as you know, the delivery of public goods and security of food supply comes at a very significant cost.
This grants the Executive Director of the European Network and Information Security Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
Secondly, I expect the Heads of State and Government to endorse the country-specific recommendations that the Commission presented on 7 June.
Can the Commission provide information on consumer awareness of the quality food schemes How can recognition of the PDO, PGI and TSG labels be improved and made more relevant to consumers, in particular, in Member States that have few registered products
Downward pressure is being exerted on prices by the low production costs and low social, environmental and quality standards in third countries, which cannot be compared with the standards in the EU. When new trading relationships are established, it is essential for us to protect European production levels by including safeguard clauses.
There is still time before the adoption of the generic laws. I hope everyone agrees that the constitution has to be balanced, close to the citizens, based on generally accepted values and principles, and should be party neutral.
As it is also my role to ask questions, I would like to ask my colleague the following do you believe that the belttightening taking place in Portugal will allow you to achieve the kind of economic growth that will enable the loans to be repaid
I find it highly regrettable that several Member States attempted, even after the conclusion of the trialogue negotiations, to throw a spanner in the works - they really did try - in connection with the correlation tables in order to block this directive.
This is not a response to one or two Prime Ministers calling for something.
Mr President, lest we forget that there are people affected by these problems, I met a young Irishman on the flight to Frankfurt today, on his way to Australia with a one-way ticket, and he is just one of thousands who are doing this because of our economic and banking problems.
The French will abolish it.
Too often, we hear from this Commission and from many in this House about over-regulation, but, as with the banks, I am starting to wonder whether we tend to put the needs of market and supply chains ahead of those of public protection and the consumer. 'Business as usual' is not going to be good enough.
All children must be able to access education, regardless of social background, and we must ensure that this opportunity is also available to the children of asylum seekers, refugees and all those who have permission, even if only temporary, to reside within the Union.
Core labour standards are embedded in the eight ILO conventions which focus on the freedom of association and collective bargaining, the elimination of forced and compulsory labour, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation and the abolition of child labour.
Space policy and the GNSS programme are of strategic importance and should provide tangible benefits for citizens and businesses.
As regards public services, the Commission's chosen 'negative list' approach is dangerous.
Mr President, I should like to say this to the Commissioner the bank crisis resolution is being elaborated at an international level and there are also important competition issues to address, but this does not mean that everything has to wait, in particular when we have a combined sovereign debt and banking crisis.
When we joined the European Union, there were fears that Poland and the new Member States would not make proper use of the opportunities afforded to them by membership, and that European funds would be spent without due consideration.
This report is on the annual report from the Council to the European Parliament on the main aspects and basic choices of the common foreign and security policy CFSP in 2009, presented to the European Parliament in application of Part II, Section G, paragraph 43 of the interinstitutional agreement of 17 May 2006.
Those conditions are most certainly linked to the modernisation of school education systems.
To this effect, the Commission has put forward consistent proposals in the context of the current revision of the Financial Regulation.
Taken as a whole, the action plan is designed to ensure that the European market, too, can compete in this sector, the worldwide market value of which is forecast to further grow to EUR 230 billion by 2025.
That is, indeed, an innovative assumption, but I think it is a matter of character.
Indeed, it cannot simply be involved at the end of the process, whereby its activity is reduced to merely agreeing or disagreeing with the final solution, without having a range of relevant indicators at its disposal in order to make a considered decision.
I advocate that we continue along this path. I believe that Parliament can make a great contribution towards raising the Commission to another level. I wish Mr Fjellner all the best and would like to extend my warm thanks to my parliamentary staff, particularly Bent Adamsen and Dominykas Mordas.
Therefore, with proper use of the arrest warrant, proportionality, strict application of the instrument, better exchange of information and training on European issues for magistrates, we are sure that uniform application of this important instrument can be achieved in full.
In recent years, it is, in fact, young people who have felt the effects of the crisis most acutely.
The new protocol provides for a financial contribution for access to the exclusive economic zone EEZ of Sao Tome and Principe equivalent to fishing opportunities at a value of EUR 2 047 500 over a three-year period.
In relation to cohesion policy, I am pleased to see that the committee has adopted my suggestion that structural funds earmarked for transport should have a greater focus on the general EU orientation of transport policy.
Madam President, please do not regard my attitude as impolite but I will address the left of the House the majority comprising Greens, Communists, Socialists and Liberals, who forced this topic on today's agenda in contradiction with the PPE and Conservative groups. I have questions for you.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Falbr since it focuses precisely on the importance of safeguarding human rights and the fact that the European social model is an important starting point, including in terms of the Union's external relations.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that, within the European Union, individual Member States still deliver early education very differently from one another.
I voted for this initiative because Romania and Bulgaria adopted the Schengen acquis when they joined the EU in 2007.
One necessary component of effective enforcement is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act immediately to order a disclosure of the debtor's assets and to freeze them.
Mr Disselkoen's lawyer says he was held there in a prison which was just as filthy and overcrowded as the one in which he was held in 1997.
It is absolutely crucial for the European Commission to make adjustments for the current situation and realities of life in the country in question when negotiating partnership agreements.
We are aware that the minimal proposal falls short of our aspirations by a long stretch, but our vote is also an expression of our confidence that the process will not end here and that an important step has been taken by acknowledging the need to internalise transport costs.
This is why it is not appropriate for national measures aimed at tackling the crisis and its consequences to be made to clash with European measures.
Some of the elements which are being contested can, in fact, be found in a number of other constitutions in other Member States, and yet we are only debating one constitution in one Member State.
Given that the workers in these sectors are mainly women who are generally responsible for their own family, both in terms of raising children and looking after elderly relatives, I would like to ask the Commission whether any statistics are available on domestic workers at EU level and the level of each Member State. I would also like to ask what measures the Commission is intending to take to ensure not only the necessary flexibility but also the respect for the rights of these workers.
It also calls on the Court of Auditors to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the agencies' approach to the management of situations where there is a potential conflict of interests. I am very satisfied with the readiness of the Court to do so.
Investor protection in Lithuania is an even greater problem; in this area, Lithuania ranks 93rd.
There are simply no real safeguards.
We must find solutions that make artistic creation attractive within the European Union and, at the same time, secure a playing field in international competition.
The experiences of EU Member States can be used when organising such programmes.
Attention should also be drawn to the fact that, when establishing a new financing instrument for developing countries alone, there must be a thorough analysis of the general objectives, the priority areas and expected results, as well as the allocation of funds.
It has now become essential to reduce excessive administrative burdens, in particular, to encourage greater participation by SMEs in the Seventh Framework Programme.
Social responsibility must work to this end and the European Union - working through Parliament - must restore and reinforce these principles in its every action, above all in dealing with non-Member States whose citizens are denied fundamental rights.
In this area, both governments and the European Union have much to do, principally through education.
The reference framework for the free movement of workers is laid down in Council Regulation EEC No 161268 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community and has been revised several times.
However, I regret the shortcomings in the management of the fixed assets' inventory identified by the Court of Auditors but note the Agency's assurance that this will be remedied in the 2010 accounts; considers that uncertainty about the location of fixed assets is another illustration of the problems and additional costs arising from using two sites.
The experience of the past two years in particular has confirmed that the achievement of strong competitiveness, sustainable economic growth and job availability requires a sustainable level of government deficit and debt, reforms to eliminate macroeconomic imbalances and a decisive EU strategy for growth and employment. I have to confess to a certain personal embarrassment over the introduction of administrative elements into the economic mechanisms.
Food security, food safety, biodiversity, climate change, new technologies and creating a viable, competitive market-led industry have to be the focus.
We are pleased that the Commission took this legislative initiative in April 2010, but in our opinion, it was much too tentative in the way it went about it. We in Parliament and all of the groups have called for this to be done much more quickly, because the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and the United Nations have already been discussing these matters for 15 years.
Madam President, I should like to say this to the Vice-PresidentHigh Representative I appreciate very much what you said in your first speech on your policy and what you have been doing with North Africa - Egypt, Tunisia, Libya - and especially the focus you put on the young people and women there, and your approach to deep democracy that has to be rooted. I think that is essential, and all of us here in this House share that view with you, so I hope this will be successful.
We share similar challenges the rise of China, the global financial crisis, decreasing demographics and the need to access raw materials and energy sources and to achieve price stability.
This was the reason for establishing the special committee on the policy challenges and budgetary resources for a sustainable European Union after 2013 SURE, which defines in its report the political priorities of the European Parliament ahead of the start of talks on the next MFF following 2013.
While that is also the dominant vision in the Commission communication, it is not our vision.
To be brief, notwithstanding the exceptional length of the text, Parliament calls for the European budget, in its total amount and distribution, to be adapted after 2013 to the competences and very large number of priorities of the European Union, as it defines them.
Allergy sufferers in particular stand to gain from this proposal, as fur is potentially hazardous to their health, and the Commission must also study the possibility that potentially hazardous materials and chemicals used in textiles may lead to allergic reactions.
Even the Spanish Members must understand that.
Increased trust among Member States will also reduce the recourse by Member States to unilateral initiatives to temporarily reintroduce internal borders or to intensify police checks at internal border zones.
There is a danger that Commission proposals for governance of the Schengen zone are seen to be prioritising European procedure over European substance.
It therefore demands for it to be increased - by at least 5 in the first instance.
To this end it is essential to bring forward projects that are sustainable in terms of costs and resources, and flexible in so much as every city is different and calls for solutions that best suit its demands.
However, any refusal to execute a European Arrest Warrant does not invalidate it. It remains a valid title for the arrest of the person concerned in the issuing Member State and indeed in any other Member State.
As such, it needs to increase its role in all the multilateral organisations and, in particular, the United Nations UN, where its role must be increasingly active following the launch of the European External Action Service EEAS. Given that global partnerships are instrumental in achieving jointly identified global goals; that the EU is the world's largest provider of development aid and a major partner of the UN in its efforts across all three pillars of its work, including in crisis and post-crisis situations; and that Member States' contribution amounts to 38 of the UN's regular budget, we believe a solid and stable EU-UN partnership is fundamental to the work of the UN and key to the EU's role as a global player.
This is part of the package of six legislative texts on economic governance and aims to strengthen surveillance of budgetary positions, and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies.
It is a matter of doing this as quickly as possible.
I voted in favour of this report on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste to send a clear message to the Member States polluters must be held responsible for their waste.
Various other corrections and compensations have since been added, making the EU revenue mechanism entirely inequitable and anything but transparent.
Mr President, if I may take this opportunity, speaking on behalf of Her Majesty's Government, I want to respond to Mr Verhofstadt who, as ever, has missed the point and who, as ever, is facing in the wrong direction.
Today, Parliament has adopted the report produced by Mr Coelho on the full application of the provisions of the Schengen acquis in Bulgaria and Romania.
Yet we are accused of being poor managers I think that we need to ramp up our communication efforts.
Have you campaigned against Syria chairing the UN Human Rights Council Have you pushed for an international inquiry into the massacres Even if you do not manage to persuade the Heads of State - and I agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit here - say so, do not leave us guessing It is this ambiguity that weighs us down.
No one is seeking to prejudge the outcome of the implementation of the Hungarian constitution but I do think that this Parliament is concerned that the Hungarian constitution must also adhere to the rule of accreditation of political pluralism and the alternation of different political projects under the same set of rules of play.
Mrs Hirsch's report embraces the Commission measures aimed at breaking down barriers, increasing transparency, and making for ease of comparison for the purposes of recognition within and between education systems, emphasising that it is important to ensure that education is geared more closely to the needs of the labour market, helping to boost creativity and innovation.
However, the questions raised and my previous question to the Commission about the very high cost of this particular endeavour have remained unanswered.
Governmental authorities representing the North signed the comprehensive peace treaty with the stipulation that the question of self-determination for South Sudan was to be resolved during the referendum.
For Croatian to be an official language, the Treaty has to be modified.
It is also important for education and training programmes to be more closely linked to business needs and to stimulate young people's potential and creativity so as to make them more competitive on the labour market. I support the efforts to encourage youth mobility, both during their education and in connection with their professional life. I think that this is an important condition for developing new skills and their self-awareness of their European identity.
We need to ensure that there is a balance between ensuring that the money is properly spent and making funds easily accessible, particularly for smaller organisations.
My group has been monitoring this issue and, in particular, that of Darfur, over the course of several parliamentary sessions, and successfully sponsored the candidacy of the Sudanese lawyer, Salih Mahmoud Osman, for the 2007 Sakharov Prize.
This is the Europe that we value, a Europe that is capable of responding to specific needs and adapting, where necessary, measures that have already been taken when they are no longer sufficient for the changes in circumstances.
We cannot do a U-turn on this success, but instead we must protect, strengthen and develop it. I hope this Council sends out a strong, clear message to this effect, emphasising that the Member States need to respect and implement the Schengen rules properly and effectively.
Therefore, I would say that this is a positive first step. I would like to thank the Commission and the rapporteur.
For its part, the Commission should ensure adequate levels of funding. I should also note that, of the 15 actions included in the Commission's action plan, nine should have an immediate application.
At the same time, it will enable companies to provide goods and services without being subjected to unnecessary legal obstacles.
Building on what we have already talked about are mobility, market access and money, or the 'three Ms', as a simple way of describing it. Some things are extremely important to support these countries into the future.
The strengthening of economic governance and the importance of cohesion policy are some of the areas that I would like to emphasise in the pursuit of a smarter, more sustainable and more inclusive Europe. I consider it important to create an intermediate category for regions whose per capita gross domestic product GDP is between 75 and 90 of EU GDP, thus contributing to increased equality at regional level.
Last week, the Commission presented a communication on a more structured approach to migration, referring, inter alia, to a proposal on a reinforced Schengen governance system.
We will probably need common rules in this area, otherwise there may be disputes or people may be excluded and told that the matter does not concern them because they are citizens of another state.
The report acknowledges the need for more resources to be put in place to meet the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, to develop European policies and to meet the commitments arising from enlargement and the Treaty of Lisbon.
One single party adopted this constitution, without public or professional consultations, and its draftsmen have dubious democratic legitimacy.
Mr President, the ECR Group believes that capital punishment is a personal conscience issue for each MEP and, although we acknowledge the EU's common position opposing execution in all circumstances, the fact of the matter is that many millions of European citizens, our constituents, are still in favour of capital punishment.
This Parliament is prepared to work in good faith to create this mechanism a mechanism that does not apply double standards; in other words, that is not more demanding of candidate countries than of those that are already members of the club.
The Member States must commit themselves to continuing with the programmes as there must be increased collaboration between technology platforms, universities and the industrial sector as well as further simplification of procedures to eliminate the difficulties faced by small and medium-sized enterprises in accessing the research and development programmes.
We have therefore made considerable progress in the negotiations with the Council.
Emergency measures therefore need to be adopted that give an immediate and suitable response to the sector's socio-economic needs, such as the creation of a guarantee fund, paid for at Union level, that ensures the stability of fuel prices and the use of all financial possibilities and margins of the EU budget to finance extraordinary support measures for the sector.
Unlike the rapporteur, and I am saying this as a German, I am of the opinion that the Commission proposal for an intermediate category will result in a balanced and transparent structure for future cohesion policy in the light of the dramatic problems in some regions.
Who are our preferential partners The United States, emerging countries, or others How can we achieve the best results By leaving individual Member States free to define their own policy, as we have for the last 60 years, or by speaking with one strong voice
If, today, regions are seeking to re-dedicate resources in addition to the resources already available, we are certainly very open, in this area, to the idea of opening up this opportunity or, in any case, to holding serious talks in this regard.
There are precedents clearly indicating that, faced with unexpected, abrupt migratory pressures, as was the case in the Canary Islands, in Spain, between 2004 and 2006, the response given cannot just be more, better Europe, but also a supportive contribution to the demand for better democracy in the neighbouring countries.
Their absence is justified because MPs in Minsk are not elected freely.
The next item is the recommendation for second reading, on behalf of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, on the Council position at first reading with a view to the adoption of a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 199962EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures 1514512010 - C7-00452011 - rapporteur Mr El Khadraoui.
On these aspects, we should do everything we can within the context of the Partnership for Modernisation to help their roots to spread across Russia and develop.
In addition, the European Parliament was able to put its clear stamp on this regulation.
Registered entities will also have to declare their sources of income and interests, as well as legislative proposals submitted.
In the wake of the severe floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of 2010, the European Union wished to provide aid in the form of exceptional trade preferences.
The proposal creates environmental economic accounts as satellite accounts to ESA 95 by providing methodology, common standards, definitions, classifications and accounting rules, intended to be used for compiling environmental economic accounts.
To push forward energy change, we need to bring the electricity from northern Germany to Austria.
Within the light of the responses to this consultation, the Commission issued an action plan in 2003, proposing, inter alia, the elaboration of a common frame of reference and containing definitions, common principles and model rules, with a view to improving the quality and coherence of European contract law.
I fully support the ILO's initiative to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers.
The need for unanimity is paralysing us. It no longer works with 27 Member States.
I believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach towards the proper coordination of the management of the spectrum across the EU in view of the fact that this public good is a scarce and finite resource and is crucial to the furtherance of consumers, citizens and businesses within the single market.
Bulgaria and Romania have been Member States of the EU for four years, but some fellow Members appear not to have noticed that, and some of their questions and racist remarks about these countries really concern me as an EU citizen, because if we talk about illegal immigrants from these countries somehow invading our territory, we are actually referring to members and citizens of the EU, and they surely cannot be illegal immigrants.
The report sets out various priorities, some of which are important and others less so, but in any case, they are all very expensive.
You are definitely wrong, Mr Helmer, because it is about solidarity.
One necessary component of effective enforcement of judgments is that courts must be able, as an interim measure, to act swiftly to order a disclosure of the debtor's assets and to freeze them.
During a period of economic decline, investments are needed to preserve jobs and foster development.
It also condemns the growing number of atypical contracts, a sign that work is increasingly becoming insecure. I give my vote to this initiative, while deploring the fact that this initiative will have no real impact.
This requires Parliament to be kept regularly informed, in order to ensure a concerted evaluation of the whole negotiation process, and so that it can express its opinions and priorities at the same time.
Before being able to think about the possible admittance of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen area, special and detailed plans must be drawn up to contain migratory pressures.
In addition, the principle has been established that Member States will be able to specify the use to be made of revenue generated from tolls collected and that at least 15 will have to be used for financial support for TEN-T projects.
This is why, alarmed at this act of genocide, I lodged a criminal complaint against the IMF's representative in Romania, Jeffrey Franks, as well as against the local henchmen. I appeal to the European Parliament and World Health Organisation to take a stance on this to prevent a Member State of the European Union turning into an extermination camp.
Combating illegal fishing, creating jobs, reducing poverty levels in third countries and supplying the EU market with quality products for its consumers are the key objectives that should be guaranteed under this agreement with Mauritania.
In all cases, the prime concern must be to consider the higher needs and interests of the child.
It is important to underline the necessity of consumer rights, particularly those related to online purchases, in this and future reports in this area.
However, sadly, some provisions miss the point. I would have welcomed it if the Council in particular had agreed on more objective solutions that were sympathetic to small businesses.
Therefore, and also bearing in mind that an impact assessment must be encouraged to assess the repercussions of the agreement inside the EU, I voted in favour of Amendment 43, which rejects the European Commission proposal to grant preferences to Pakistan.
Our decision will send an unambiguous signal to Pakistan that we want to help and that we would like Pakistan to become a stable and rich country, which will prevent opinion becoming radicalised there. I believe that this Pakistan, as our ally, would also help to solve the deadlocked situation in Afghanistan.
Finally, we believe that in order to make the European Union budget more equitable and transparent, the existing exceptions and correction mechanisms should be progressively phased out.
I take this opportunity to express my opposition to a unilateral increase in the European target for greenhouse gas emission reductions to beyond 20 by 2020, given the lack of a global climate agreement involving all the major emitters.
This would benefit European citizens in two ways - easing access to modern means of communication and telecom networks would reduce the exclusion of EU citizens which still exists, particularly for those living in rural and peripheral areas, and would promote the EU economy more actively, because there would be stronger conditions for developing an innovative services sector and knowledge economy.
We are by far the leaders in addressing the needs of people in Libya.
I am voting for this report because I understand that only by reinforcing European research, development and innovation policy will it be possible for it to increase its competitiveness and adopt an increasingly leading role at global level. I also consider it important that the Seventh Framework Programme contributes to establishing the European Research Area, pursuant to Article 1791 of Title XIX of the Treaty on European Union.
The EU did not intervene here with financial aid.
In general, we agree with the implementation of the 3 x 20 objectives which have already been set, but the scale and cost of undertakings associated with the possible adoption of a 30 reduction in greenhouse gas emissions would be enormous.
That requires access to Internet and broadband applications with the greatest capacity and the highest speed.
The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on EU-Japan trade relations by Daniel Caspary and Jarosaw Leszek Waesa, on behalf of the PPE Group, Syed Kamall, Robert Sturdy and Jan Zahradil, on behalf of the ECR Group, Niccolo Rinaldi, Metin Kazak and Marielle De Sarnez, on behalf of the ALDE Group, and Emilio Menendez del Valle, David Martin and Vital Moreira, on behalf of the SD Group O-0000882011rev.1 - B7-02202011.
For example, the report presented stresses that, due to complicated rules, there is slow uptake of European Union funds earmarked for TEN and TNI projects and other cohesion policy priorities. I feel that in this area there is an urgent need to ensure the simplification, effectiveness and transparency of procedures.
The Commission should ensure that EU aid is consistent with development goals and targets set at international level. I would also reiterate the importance of how thoroughly eligibility criteria for countries benefiting from funding from this future instrument are applied. I would like to stress that the new DCI should provide a basis for targeted and more flexible aid in situations of fragility. I believe it should help to ensure proper linkage of relief, rehabilitation and development operations.
If implemented correctly by national bodies, this international agreement will be an important tool for ensuring the long-term protection of marine life and the sustainable exploitation of fish stocks.
All these major transformations are making the European Union commit itself actively, alongside the other partners, to promoting effective solutions to the problems affecting both European citizens and the whole of humanity.
We have to tell Canada to back off.
I would like to reply right away by saying that the Secretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General put a lot of effort into ensuring our safety in Parliament.
The rapporteur was concerned about the transparency of Eurofound's human resources management, and these concerns were echoed by the other members of the Committee on Budgets. I think there would be advantage in those concerns being dispelled.
There is no doubt that the scale of the economic meltdown in Greece, coupled with the risk of a similar crisis hitting many other Member States, urgently requires a strategy to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
It is the responsibility of the Commission, Parliament, the Member States, the competent authorities and every local community concerned, and all of us, to make this a reality.
In addition, changes to the EU's Staff Regulations can only be made within the framework of a codecision procedure between Parliament and the Council.
If laws regulating consumer transactions were harmonised throughout the EU, small and medium businesses SMEs and consumers in all Member States would benefit.
Following the visits made on the ground and the technical evaluations which were carried out, not only the rapporteur appointed by the European Parliament but the group of experts, too, concluded that Romania fulfils all the criteria for joining the Schengen area, which were provisions assumed through the Treaty of Accession in 2005.
The greening of payments of the first pillar will also make it possible to encourage farmers to adopt good farming practices and to be more economically and ecologically efficient.
As the largest market for such products, the European Union should therefore support measures aimed at preventing violations of fisheries legislation.
Madam President, I have a point of order under Rule 96 by prearrangement with the President, whom I would ask to write to the Formula One Teams Association - including Lotus in my own constituency - which made clear in a letter yesterday that it objected to a rearranged Bahrain Grand Prix on logistical grounds.
Finally, please believe me when I say that I will not allow a watered-down stress test to take place.
What is more, we still do not have a proper stress test for the insurance market. I am calling on you, Mr Barnier, also to take a close look at this area. I am disappointed that the European Banking Authority, which we established and which is responsible for the stress tests, actually failed its own stress test.
The next item is the report by Mr Dess, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the CAP towards 2020 meeting the food, natural resources and territorial challenges of the future.
While it upholds the original structure of Objective 3, the report proposes an increase in funds and draws attention to the specific needs of border populations. A strategic approach and a response aimed at the needs and idiosyncrasies of every region can be guaranteed by allocating funds on the basis of harmonised criteria for every territorial cooperation programme.
Although the decision establishing a Community action for the European Capital of Culture 2007-2019 only currently covers EU Member States, the truth is that the opportunity to win the title of European Capital of Culture has already been granted to cities of third countries on a number of occasions.
If European cultural aspects are to be more prominently included, as is proposed, as an integral part of economic, foreign, security and development policy, it depends on what explicit form this is to be given.
I would say to Martin Schulz that I also have some questions about rating agencies and the role they are playing in the current crisis, but let us try to find errors and the sources of the crisis within our own ranks, and maybe not outside the European Union and outside its institutions.
By naming the city a European Capital of Culture in 2014, we could send an important signal for the multi-ethnic character of the city and the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which could also give the political class in that country cause to rethink their ideas.
I therefore advocate respect for the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan, and I urge Sudan and South Sudan to commit themselves actively to promoting democratic governance and establishing lasting peace, security and prosperity in both countries. I consider the provision of external aid very important and I welcome the Council's 23 May 2011 decision to allocate EUR 200 million to development cooperation in South Sudan, with the aim of contributing to the autonomy of local communities, and of attending to the basic needs of the people and to the non-existence of human resources and infrastructure.
First the European Union will strive to encourage Russia to resolve the last remaining outstanding multilateral issues to facilitate WTO accession before the end of 2011, building on the EU-Russia bilateral agreement reached in 2004 and last December.
Transparency is essential in order to determine the European banks' susceptibility to crisis.
Lorca is a city of 70 000 inhabitants, of whom 20 are immigrants that the city has received, taken in and been able to give a new life with new meaning. I know that together, the old and new residents of Lorca, with help from the institutions and from everybody, will be able to begin a new journey in their lives. I also have to say and call on the European Union not to leave anyone behind and to be able to help those affected, recognise their pain and stand by their side, opening their arms and offering opportunities.
A swift and effective response by you, Commissioner, on this point would send a signal that would also help strengthen what we know are historically fragile links between the Commission and the profession.
The potential launch of negotiations on an FTA agreement was backed by the Council as long as Japan was willing to tackle non-tariff barriers on market access and restrictions on public procurement. I would like to reiterate that non-tariff barriers and public procurement are crucial areas for European businesses where Japan needs to make significant concessions.
I voted in favour of the conclusion of the Agreement on civil aviation safety between the European Community and Canada because I feel it presents a clear advantage for the European Union in so much as it establishes mutual recognition of documentation supplied in all sectors relevant to aviation for all the Member States.
We share this mission together, and this is why, as I close, I would like to ask the Commissioner to relate this serious and important discussion to the Council, which is absent today, so that in the forum of the Council, too, it will be possible to discuss these important tasks for Europe.
It is for local authorities, with support from the national government, to take responsibility for such events.
I want to welcome the adoption of this report and to underline the importance of Objective 3, which concerns territorial cooperation, in the European Union's cohesion policy.
Both in terms of payments to farmers and in terms of the second pillar - or through investments, by supporting the production of local goods - we will be able to respond to these objectives.
If not, your conscience and this Chamber will hold you to account.
It is clear that the ongoing stress test must be carried out in a stringent and transparent way that inspires confidence.
The territory of Member States which are about to introduce the single currency must be included in the cash transport system.
We must regulate the transition phase and it is essential that, through an authorization process, the bilateral investment treaties BITS concluded by Member States are respected and that they are allowed, under certain conditions, to renegotiate existing BITS or finalise pending ones and to enter negotiations for further ones.
Our joint action is particularly important, as we face the need to decide on further action in North Africa, where tensions are rising, as well as in Syria and Bahrain.
It was recommended that where projects might possibly have a considerable environmental impact, appropriate screening should be carried out - particularly as regards sensitive areas and the possible cumulative impact of projects.
Under the circumstances, nevertheless, I have no objection to granting the request in this particular case, but I would very much like to ask Members not to abuse this potential because, if they do, then the President will ask the House every time and there will be contentiousness where there should be none.
These territorial cooperation areas are privileged areas for European cooperation, particularly cross-border cooperation.
It should be easy to scrutinise how decisions are made, what are the influences behind them and finally, how resources ... are allocated'.
There are worrying tendencies towards increased tensions and conflict.
The next item is the report by Mr Mitchell, on behalf of the Committee on Development, on Regulation EC No 19052006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation lessons learned and perspectives for the future.
I would also like to say something to you, Commissioner it is true that there are some Member States that will and others that will not be able to give this aid, and that, according to you, this will create disparity.
However, simply calling for action is too vague.
The Sri Lankan Government has dismissed the panel's report, calling it illegal and biased. I believe that it is an objective reason for further investigations.
So what is in the report Of course, we are asking the Commission to come forward with a proposal to move to 25 reduction domestically.
This programme is aimed not only at creating a competitive and vibrant European industry for the provision of broadband services and equipment, but also at establishing an environment that is conducive to the development of pan-European services.
We would like all the 23 million small and medium-sized enterprises to be able to hire at least one more employee.
The role of the European Union is to help them.
The recommendations must be applied by Member States to prevent stability being jeopardised.
They lack focus and they are too complicated. I am happy to say that, in his proposals, Albert Dess has set out a very sensible framework in which we can develop future reform.
Thus, we must find means of developing an appropriate and effective tool to complement GDP, which could be applied in a practical way, using clearly defined indicators and relying on high-quality data.
On the other hand, they damage the textile industry and the countries and regions most dependent on it. All this against a backdrop of a severe economic crisis and high unemployment.
Taking into account the changes in the relevant EU customs acquis, the proposal establishes a special regime between the EU and Andorra to ensure that trade runs smoothly between the two parties while maintaining a high level of security.
I am voting for the tabled report, and I call for robust financing for the initiative, which is indispensable to sustainable growth.
I am concerned about the ineptitude of our government, but the silence of the European institutions is also striking, as if they did not want to see this violation of European law by the country holding the Presidency.
By creating a clear path for creative thinking and the resulting ideas, we can all gain intellectual and economic advantages.
This has been discussed in this House and I would like to thank Parliament for its substantial support for the proposed creation of a so-called transitional region in the next period.
Europe's cultural practitioners, technical innovators and, above all, Europe's citizens deserve a well-functioning internal market, where creative content can flow freely and generously across our borders and where cultural practitioners are secure in the knowledge that they will receive remuneration for their work.
The package - politically unthinkable prior to the crisis and certainly not yet perfect - is indeed a major step forward.
In 2006, Parliament and the Council adopted the decision on which the initiative is based.
The economic crisis has exposed the irresponsible financial and economic decisions of several governments, but it is the conscientious Member States that are paying the price.
The new protocol provides for more fishing opportunities for European fleets and has resulted in the creation of jobs both in Seychelles and in Europe. I hope that the cases of piracy that have occurred in this region will not negatively affect this activity.
Although I represent the Centre, Auvergne and Limousin regions, which do not have borders with other Member States of the European Union, I am convinced of the usefulness of cross-border cooperation - and, more generally, of territorial cooperation - for the development of Europe and for building bridges between people. I completely agree with the proposals brought forward by the rapporteur, my colleague Mrs Sanchez-Schmid, particularly when it comes to enhancing the role of the European Groupings for Territorial Cooperation EGTCs and the financing of this objective.
The proposal calls on the Member States to guarantee higher safety levels that also comply with international safety standards; greater attention to technical and scientific advances, particularly to comply with the principle of reversibility; increased emphasis on protection of the environment and people's health; and a commitment to identifying responsibility in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, with transparency and with the role of licence holders.
These reservations are borne out by statements in the report, such as that the optional instrument 'must offer a very high level of consumer protection, in order to compensate consumers for the protection that they would normally enjoy under their national law'. It also stresses that the instrument proposed at EU-level, which is the same for all contracts in the European Union, is also set out in very general terms.
Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 initiative place a far greater emphasis on social policy than was ever the case before, competitiveness and economic factors are still the centre of attention. I therefore took a very critical approach to the drafting of this report.
I decided to abstain at the final vote because we lost Amendment 1 on reference to NATO, Amendment 3 against a nuclear dimension in the common security and defence policy, Amendment 4 against flexible use of Battlegroups, Amendment 5 against using Battlegroups for mixed civilian-military tasks, Amendment 6 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 7 deleting a provision on defence research, Amendment 8 deleting reference to the US Department of Homeland Security, Amendment 9 deleting reference to CSDP cooperation with Frontex in the Mediterranean, and despite the fact that we won Amendment 2 on European External Action ServiceCommission permanent working structures and Amendment 1 saying no to NATO developing civilian capabilities.
This approach, which is for the profit of big business, is damaging to the needs of the peoples and workers, as well as being disadvantageous for the industries of the EU countries with the weakest economies.
This report stresses the need to develop European-level cooperation in the field of vocational education and training to increase transparency and for ease of comparison between the various education systems.
We have discussed countries neighbouring Europe which have nuclear programmes. I think that these issues should be included in the Commission communication on the external dimension of the EU energy policy.
If the EU is serious about increasing recycling, reducing waste and limiting air emissions and climate change, then it must take action.
It is no good us operating with 27 different systems in this important area. I therefore believe that the Commission should take a holistic approach and look at the connection between licensing, private copyright fees and piracy. I hope that this report can help to get this started and I look forward to an ambitious proposal from the Commission.
However the titles held by the banks until final maturity are listed in the banking book.
Now I believe that we have reached a turning point.
The Irish Government's Jobs Initiative has correctly concentrated on the jobs-rich sector of tourism; while the EU's Small Business Act has the potential to complement this in the area of SMEs over the coming years.
I would like to express my thanks and to say that the Commission and Europe as a whole can be pleased with what they have achieved in this case.
So, I would encourage you to examine the need for a new evaluation of the incident's impact on health.
So he proved to be very resilient in his task, and he got there.
It is only natural, therefore, that the private sectors in both the EU and Canada have shown strong support for an ambitious and comprehensive economic agreement, and believe that advancing a closer EU-Canada economic partnership would send a powerful pro-growth signal to investors and business within the EU and Canada as well as internationally. I therefore welcome an agreement with Canada that transcends the World Trade Organisation WTO commitments and is in addition to the multilateral rules, provided that the negotiations produce an ambitious, high-quality agreement, based on reciprocity and that goes beyond mere tariff reductions. I would, however, warn of the need to consider the economic impact of this opening up, especially on the Member States whose economies are more vulnerable.
The current report evaluates the development of the common security and defence policy CSDP in the wake of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.
Nowadays, gross domestic product is no longer a sufficient, appropriate indicator for measuring progress, and it is therefore necessary to develop more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base in an ever changing world.
The possibility of obtaining an EOPA without any notification and prior hearing for the relevant party is an infringement on the debtor's rights and is contrary to current case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The ILO plays an essential role on the international scene by drawing up, promoting and translating these standards into reality.
Therefore the issues concerning quality, origin and traceability must be given even higher priority.
It must be mobilised because it is a credible department, which has proved its worth, in the Libyan crisis for example. I believe that this department should be encouraged, today, to prepare a plan and to present it to the Committee on Foreign Affairs, explaining how it intends to act, to enable us to understand how valuable European Union foreign policy can be when we all work together towards the best result.
It makes me very sad that one of our major European achievements is to be put at risk.
However, this crisis has highlighted that the European system is not infallible and that we are extremely vulnerable.
This is a loan that will be paid back in full, and at interest rates similar to the market rates Portugal was paying around a month ago.
The next item is the debate on six motions for resolution on Guantanamo imminent death penalty decision.
It is unacceptable that the United States of America - considered a torchbearer of human rights and democracy - has engaged in ill-treatment and torture of the detainees of the camp.
Cultural diplomacy has an important role to play when it comes to building successful relations with third countries and, in many countries, there is a network of national institutes for culture, EUNIC, that we can make use of. There are many, many people who have linked in to the network and stand ready to help.
Some of these violations were committed with the proven complicity of Member States of the European Union, which placed their territories at the disposal of the CIA.
Environmental concerns can never be jeopardised, but at the same time, they cannot be detached from economic issues; still less in this time of crisis that we are still experiencing, and which continues to buffet the countries of southern Europe, especially my country, Portugal.
These proposals would reverse this unfair situation, giving victims a better chance of getting their money back.
That was the conclusion reached by the European Council in June 2006, when it called on the European Union and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development. I welcome this initiative and the European Commission's proposal, as it will help improve our knowledge of air emissions, environmental taxes and material flows in the economy.
In accordance with the concept of shared duties or shared management, it is the Member States andor the regions that are responsible for the implementation of the programmes on the ground.
As an example, as Mr Audy reminded us, we have already implemented three concrete simplification measures for FP7 more use of average personnel costs, easier procedures for owner-managers of SMEs, and a clearing committee to ensure a common interpretation of the rules.
It is not a question of finding who is to blame, but on this occasion, major errors have occurred, starting with the foolhardy and reckless assumptions of a regional policy manager, recently recruited to the job, who unleashed social alarm and a very serious, irreparable economic crisis.
We cannot be blind to the fact that recent events have revealed a problem in Schengen governance which we have to solve.
These Eurobonds can be issued by the EFSF, by the ESM or by a new European agency in the future.
Secondly, research and innovation policies must be tailored to the market's specific needs.
The European External Action Service EEAS will have an important role to play in this regard. I hope it will be up to the challenge.
In particular, what actions are likely to be taken based on the results of the public consultation, and, secondly, can the Commission indicate which specific pilot projects have been selected at this point
This is connected with the idea that securing a wireless broadband connection is essential in order for all citizens to have access to new and innovative services. I fully agree with the deadline proposed by the Commission as regards making the 800 MHz band available for electronic communications services by 1 January 2013.
There will always be competition between European regulations and directives and the form that these take at local level.
EU statistics show that more than 25 of young Lithuanians are forced to take low paid work and conclude short-term contracts with insufficient social security guarantees.
On the other hand, we need to see how we can use the European Fisheries Fund to support and help the countries which are in the throes of serious economic crisis to overcome these problems, so that they can help their fishermen.
What I think matters most is that we contribute to a plan of action, whose aim is to help us reach a new awareness of technology, so that new economic opportunities may be created for Europe. I believe especially in the need to train new people and in professional, young and highly qualified individuals, who are able to rise to the challenges posed by the new global market.
The strategic reasons alone - you mentioned some of them - speak for themselves.
For Russia, European scientific and technical progress has been emulated since the time of Peter the Great, but it has simultaneously been feared as something that could potentially destroy the Russian soul and way of being, and viewed as a threat to its territorial integrity.
I voted in favour of the joint motion for a resolution on Sudan and South Sudan because I support all development efforts being made by the EU in order to restore peace and reconstruct this long-suffering area.
Moreover, the other two problems would still remain firstly, overfishing would actually increase and, secondly, it would not solve the problem of market prices.
Over 30 events are planned between now and the end of 2012 when this campaign will end.
The reason for this is that all too often the Member States still consider funding from the European Regional Fund to be soft money.
I am happy to see that this approach is high on the agenda of the ongoing discussions and the proposals which are on the table really match the Commission's ambitions.
The three-year reform of the Financial Regulation will enable us to establish the legal basis for this simplification, but I do not think that tinkering with the tolerable risk of error is the right way to go. We need to simplify our regulations, and it is through simplification that we will reduce the number of errors.
The proposed strengthening of the European Defence Agency would not mean a genuine increase in the level of security in the EU, but merely the creation of another bureaucratic monster, incapable of performing the tasks assigned to it. Who would take the decision to mobilise European armed forces Whose interests would their units be acting in How much of a say would the new Member States have Would the EDA's headquarters be relocated Fears have also been voiced regarding institutional matters, such as whether growth of the EDA would not result in a reduction in the size of certain Member States' armies, and whether there would be a clash with the remit and objectives of the European External Action Service.
Unfortunately, the audit process revealed cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, recurrent delays in the execution of payments and significant changes made to the work programme during the year. I believe that such problems ought to be avoided in future years.
The result is the multiplication and deepening of social inequalities.
It takes the view that the EU should seize the opportunity of the adoption of NATO's new Strategic Concept in order to substantially strengthen its partnership with NATO while, at the same time, developing the EU's foreign, security and defence policies. I believe that an organisation-to-organisation relationship must be adopted.
Mr President, I speak as Chair of the delegation which covers Pakistan, and I must say that some real crocodile tears have been shed here tonight by people expressing views which are about 180 degrees away from those they normally express.
You have also won an equal role for Parliament in determining the scoreboard for detecting possible macroeconomic imbalances, and you have inserted firm guarantees on social dialogue, respect for national traditions on collective agreements, wage formation, and the role of social partners, which we fully share.
It is why the vote that we won at the UN, the voice that we now have, can play its part.
Is it necessary to be backward-looking and keep on defending a lack of transparency rather than openness It is, however, the duty also of the representatives of the Member States to provide information and transparency in their dealings with European citizens. I also have a wish for the future. I think that it is essential to move gradually towards an American-style system, which has 65 years' experience behind it, and which is based on the publication of key documents by lobbying groups for example, of all contracts for more than USD 10 000.
The whole of last weekend was filled with misinformation on debt restructuring and Greece's exit from the euro rumours spread by those who have wagered billions on a default they are trying to create in the first place.
When the European Union adopted Regulation No 20072000, it granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.
It is also important to help businesses combat the scam by improving access to information and awareness raising by improving redress mechanisms. I wish to ask the Commissioner what are the major obstacles for stronger involvement of state authorities in cross-border enforcement cooperation, and what measures does the Commission envisage in the fight against rogue directory companies
If the costs of the umpteenth strategy will still only finance talk, I call on the European institutions to make amends to the dozens of small entrepreneurs in my region, Veneto, who have taken their lives rather than see their small businesses fail.
However, all options should be kept open and examined at present.
What a statistic that is. Food products provided by aid agencies and intended for distribution to the poor for free are now being sold on the market.
It is doubtful whether the EU can reconcile these matters of public interest and these characteristics as well and as efficiently as its Member States.
Statement by the President of the European Parliament's delegation to the Conciliation Committee - Novel foods continuation of debate 
This is an initiative of the Committee on International Trade, of which I am chair, and it is as chair that I am asking this question, in relation to which the political groups have reached agreement by consensus. I am pleased to be asking this question, which has had the approval of the political group coordinators on my committee and which seeks a response from the European Commission on a range of concerns regarding the state of play of the EU-India Free Trade Agreement FTA negotiations, which have been ongoing since 2007.
In relation to Schengen suspension, the Commission is proposing an EU mechanism instead of Member State decision, but this has been widely misinterpreted to mean that the reintroduction of internal borders will actually be easier in practice.
Cities are currently facing various and disparate problems, requiring the implementation of tailored and integrated local development models.
Adding a green component to the first pillar in conjunction with a stronger rural development policy is another key objective that will help to tackle climate change and environmental issues, but will also contribute to achieving the Europe 2020 strategy.
Mr President, with 22 people dead in the EU and over 2 000 taken in for treatment as a result of the ongoing E coli outbreak across Europe, it is appropriate that this Parliament extends its sympathies to those who have lost loved ones and our good wishes for a recovery to others.
As a Christian-Democrat, I am absolutely delighted that there is a reference to God and Christianity, because it is a fundamental part of our culture and our history and I think it is far better to have it included than excluded and creating a godless society.
This situation must be borne in mind, and we must anticipate that the freeing up of frequencies will only be possible when countries such as Russia and Belarus also do so. Member States must not be placed in the forefront of the European Union's ambitions without regard to the facts on the ground.
There are two priorities on which I would like to focus the Commissioner's attention, and these are promotion and enhancement of the multi-level governance system and synergy between the various funds, in other words an integrated vision and approach to funding.
It is now vital for the lessons to be learnt from what has happened to avoid a similar situation recurring in the future.
I endorsed the report because the added value of EU membership in multilateral organisations lies in the fields where it has exclusive or shared competences economic and trade matters, environmental policy, development aid, and security and defence policy.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by congratulating our rapporteur, Mr Dess, the shadow rapporteurs and other contributors on the work that they have done to draft this text.
Only the resolution tabled by my group, together with those by the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance and the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, offered a progressive vision of EU-India trade relations.
For transparency in EU agencies to be improved, all 21 Agencies and the Commission must publish a list of all contracts awarded over the last three years as well as a report of the staff members changing jobs from one agency to another, and they must enact stricter rules regarding conflicts of interest as soon as possible.
We do not deny the need for there to be ways for the various Member States to cooperate, link up and coordinate their activities to control and combat illegal fishing, but we were sceptical of the benefits of creating the Community Fisheries Control Agency CFCA because we believe that some of its competences clash with those of the Member States.
This is an unacceptable situation. I agree, therefore, with the main thesis of the Simpson report on international air agreements, which has been adopted today.
Now we have to declare loud and clear that these objectives can only be achieved if we assign sufficient resources to them.
Mr Moreira has presented us with a proposal for a recommendation on the draft Council decision on the conclusion of a Protocol between the EU and the Principality of Andorra extending to customs security measures the Agreement in the form of an Exchange of Letters between the two partners concluded on 28 June 1990. A new Title IIA is to be added to the agreement in force, covering agricultural products.
Another issue that we absolutely must address is how we are to finance the EU budget, and in this regard, our group has been very clear.
We therefore call for effective regulation of the financial sector, and putting a stop to the liberalisation of capital movements, to tax havens, to derivatives, and to CRAs and their operations.
I welcomed this important document because, through Regulation EC No 20072000, the European Union has granted exceptional unlimited duty-free access to the EU market for nearly all products originating in the countries and territories benefiting from the Stabilisation and Association process.
On the other hand, it is important for the EU to provide financial support for energy projects and innovation.
In the Czech Republic, forestry management has become a business, in which the financial profits of the firms involved are all that matters.
However, I trust that he recognises the mandate which he has been given by MEPs, and accordingly entertains their views as Governor of the ECB.
Greater competition is required in the sector and we must break up this historic oligopoly and try to bring in new, independent and possibly European organisations, which would therefore have a proper awareness of the economic context and reality of our continent, which is entirely different from the way of thinking in the United States.
For there is one thing that must be clear to us, which is that for the 16th time in succession the European Court of Auditors has not given a positive statement.
It is also important for Germany that the European Union continues to develop in a harmonious way, because this brings benefits for Germany.
The Spanish Socialist delegation has voted in favour of the Merkies report on the Innovation Union transforming Europe for a post-crisis world, because we agree with and are committed to the fundamental principles the report sets forth, which lay down the groundwork for transition to an intelligent, sustainable and fair European economy.
Mr President, my group agrees with the mandate for negotiating with the governments, which we are here to adopt today, but I would nonetheless like to raise a political issue that is not in the document in question, and which relates to what is currently happening in Greece and my country, Portugal, and to recent statements by Jean-Claude Juncker.
In this regard, I would also like to express my approval of the European Commission's proposals for new measures, including, among others, proposals for creating a category of intermediate regions. I think that work on a new structure will increase effectiveness and allow the policy to be pursued in a way which measures up to the challenges we currently face.
This is the only way, because we cannot be sure about the evolution of fuel prices.
I am voting in favour of the appointment of Mr Draghi as President of the ECB as I believe that he has an extensive academic background and wide professional experience, and because I advocate a strong commitment from the European institutions to combating inflation, to strengthening the single currency and to sustainability in the sovereign debt crisis. I also believe that the new President of the ECB will implement a culture of honesty and rigour, as well as helping to set out robust and consistent economic policy, sending a clear signal of confidence to the international markets.
Therefore, some of the principal questions arising from this debate are left without the required response arms deals, the expansionist and warmongering policies of Israel and the systematic non-compliance with United Nations resolutions on the Western Sahara and Palestine.
I decided to vote against this proposal because it would have a very negative impact on the smallest haulage companies in particular.
For these reasons, as a matter of national interest and as a member of Parliament's Committee on Transport and Tourism, I voted against the document tabled in plenary.
With due regard for the opinions of the legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which have concluded that the Commission proposal was confined to a straightforward codification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance, I welcome the adoption of this proposal.
What is more, I must observe - and Mr Dalli said it himself - that the German authorities clearly took the view that they would do without European Union experts, patronisingly and arrogantly believing that they had no need for them.
We have a much better partnership with Russia.
I expect ex ante conditionality to be fully integrated into the programming process. I also expect ex ante conditionalities to be directly linked to the policy and to programme effectiveness, that their number will be limited, and that they will be tailored to the specific context and respect agreed criteria.
I voted for this report because the Court of Auditors has stated that is has reasonable assurances that the 2009 accounts for the European Food Safety Authority EFSA are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, and because on 5 May 2010 Parliament granted the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the EFSA's 2008 budget.
The Commission acknowledges that the Greek crisis has a high social cost for sections of the population in Greece, but that cost is mainly the result of financial imbalances, diminishing competitiveness and financial difficulties the very difficulties the Memorandum seeks to resolve and not exacerbate.
This financial reform package will hit the poorest in Europe the hardest, while leaving the cause of the crisis - the financial sector - untouched. I welcome improved coordination of economic and fiscal policy in Europe, but strongly oppose the short-term vision under which this is being imposed.
Adopting this ILO convention on domestic workers will be an essential element in ensuring that domestic workers' human, social and employment rights are respected.
We have the Europe envisaged by David Cameron or the Dutch Government - or at least by the party that supports the government in the Dutch Chamber of Deputies - a Europe of ever deeper cuts, a Europe of increasing withdrawal from integrationist development and a Europe of renationalisation.
Obviously, if the President of the Commission says that we have to uphold the principle of free movement of persons, then I will support that. 25,000 Tunisians cannot be allowed to take 502 million Europeans hostage, but these questions will not go away and public support for Schengen in Europe will be jeopardised.
The first years of childhood are crucial for children's cerebral, physical, emotional and personal development, for acquiring language, and are the foundation of lifelong learning.
Furthermore, the adoption of innovative solutions is closely bound up with pre-commercial procurement, which resolves issues which the market cannot cover or where the solutions proposed are uneconomic.
Yes, there is corruption in Bulgaria and Romania, but there is corruption in every Member State, and the Commission proposed only yesterday a report on how we want to enforce the struggle against corruption.
Greater controls are therefore to be welcomed and I hope that the new European authority will manage to operate at optimum capacity, with real powers to intervene and even to issue penalties where necessary. I also believe that it is a fine idea to introduce the principle of civil liability in situations of obvious negligence.
European funds for promotion are available to operators to promote quality products, with more than EUR 19 million being allocated to fifteen promotion programmes between 2006 and 2010.
This is also essential in order for the various sectoral policies to be better coordinated, and for resources to be used more efficiently.
Every Member State has to take responsibility for the ownership of our Union and start acting for the common good of Europe.
In short, its aim is to draw conclusions from the global financial crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of the Lehman Brothers bank in autumn 2008, related to the inappropriate securitisation of US subprime mortgages.
I endorsed this document because, in 2009, the EU and Japan represented together more than a quarter of world GDP and more than 20 of world trade, and Japan and the EU are significant investors in each other's economies.
Trade policy cannot ignore any failure in respecting workers' rights, and the development of society may continue only after such obstacles have been removed.
To this end, there is a need to breathe new life into it by simplifying procedures, but also by reinforcing the EU's common agricultural policy CAP budget, so I consider it very positive that the report calls for the CAP budget to be maintained at least until 2013, with it unlikely that Parliament will accept any reduction.
It is important to have made some progress in this direction with Mr Vlasak's report, with which I strongly agree, and I believe that this report will allow us to better define the legal framework of the urban issue and also to introduce tools such as the municipal operational programmes as operational programmes capable of giving a new quality to cohesion policy.
We also think that research and innovation in the European Union can only be developed by cutting red tape, simplifying and converging procedures, developing applied research and making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to access funding.
Mr President, the German and European authorities are still trying to identify the source of the E coli outbreak.
To achieve this, the High-Representative should set up a 'Cultural diplomacy' Directorate-General within the European External Action Service, and appoint someone to be responsible for cultural relations and for promoting European culture in every EU representation in third countries.
However, I think it is equally important, and perhaps even more important, for there to be specific and real involvement from the European Union in building civil society, providing financial support for non-governmental organisations and free media, and also in imposing economic sanctions.
Patient questionnaires for outbreak investigations are being collected and compared by the ECDC.
The introduction of an Anglo-Franco-German European patent is unacceptable for at least two reasons.
I should just like to make one remark to say that I regret the Council's reluctance to sign up to this common register.
In 2006, the Commission proposed a 'one-stop shop' to register lobbyists of the Commission and Parliament.
The rising economic importance of Asia, the revolutionary movements in Africa, the increased terrorist threat, the need to establish joint and sustainable European raw materials strategies and ever more frequent violations of human rights are just a few of the problems with which EU diplomacy has to contend today.
However, beyond the stated desire to encourage the Member States to step up their investments in the area of education independently from the financial crisis, the report is in the spirit of the policies aimed at liberalising higher education and subordinating it to the sole immediate interests of the market and thus of companies.
Howver, I realise that there are still questions to be answered, since the Council of Ministers represents the states. I am, however, confident that we will come to a positive conclusion.
To this end, the Commission should present a proposal for such actions, which will then be recast as an official document.
However, since this report makes very reasonable arguments in this regard, I voted in favour.
The negative results of the mid-term review mean that we need to amend its priorities. I therefore agree on rewording the main objectives and stress the need for a more efficient research policy that cuts out the burden of red tape and provides for greater participation from small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as innovation and funding integration.
The necessary solidarity with Pakistan must be genuine aid based on development aid and cooperation policy.
Moreover, the risks for carbon leakage have been reduced further, since now more than 80 countries, amongst which all emerging economies, are implementing the pledges they committed to in Copenhagen and are implementing their domestic targets. I must say that the Commission has no evidence that companies are moving their production outside the EU due to climate policy.
While I think that priority should be given firstly to data already available that is, collected at regional, national and European level, I believe that if the need arises for additional modules, which does not entail unnecessary bureaucracy or additional costs, in this case, Eurostat should be allowed to gather data from Member States with a view to setting up environmental economic accounts at European level.
The greater audit transparency and the improved performance shown by all those involved in the management of European funds are the two main reasons that lead me to support this discharge.
After around a year's work, the special committee on policy challenges and budgetary resources has finally presented the future decisions determining priorities in expenditure for the efficient and effective use of European Union appropriations leading to the implementation of result-oriented policies.
The drafting of the constitution has been accused of being undemocratic, yet people are ignoring the fact that the vast majority of Hungarians supported this constitution.
Moreover, as the rapporteur states, the data that is obtained can, and should, contribute to policy evaluation, enabling assessment of the environmental impact of economic activities.
The summit must serve to review security and energy policy, which must be implemented on the criteria of interdependency, transparency, supply guarantees and the fight against climate change, as well as improved energy efficiency.
We need to help boost skills and spread information - the EURES network is very useful there and that is what the Commission directly supports - and also help mobility, because job opportunities and vacancies very often come up in different regions or different countries.
In an unstable economic climate, we must not neglect to invest substantially in early childhood education and care ECEC services. I feel that the Member States should devote appropriate resources to ECEC services.
What a change in comparison to the era when Europe was scattered with border posts where checks - nit-picking ones at times - were the norm, not to mention the impossibility for citizens in the East to cross the iron curtain without risking their lives
The Ecofin Council will review compliance with the programme for the first quarter at its meeting on 17 May, next Tuesday. I cannot say much in advance about that discussion, but the overall assessment is likely to be that Ireland's performance is in line with expectations.
The milk crisis made it clear that measures to restrict production are needed in the milk sector.
Despite the economic crisis we are experiencing, it is important to maintain these instruments for aiding developing countries so that they may be able, in the near future, to increase their levels of wealth, with the inherent improvement in the living conditions of the populations in these so-called emerging countries.
You have only shared responsibility for 2009, yet you have thrown yourself into it. In some cases we have had heated arguments and have gone into very great detail. I should like to emphasise, however, that you have put the discharge at the top of the agenda in the College, in the Commission.
Particularly worrying is the fact that according to 2009 data, the majority of discrepancies as regards antibiotic agents were found in honey, rabbit and farmed fish samples, in other words, products that are frequently considered to be valuable foodstuffs and are often used in Europeans' daily diet.
Given the critical role played by parents as 'main educators', the report seeks to improve parental leave - which should be long enough to enable parents to play their leading role in educating their children in the early stages of their life - and encourages the Member States to invest in parental education programmes as well as provide other forms of assistance to parents who require additional help.
Yet here you have an extraordinary political space opening up in front of you with the Arab revolutions, and the role of European diplomacy in that space needs to be made very clear, because beyond the specific characteristics of each country, it is true that everything is connected.
The 'more' that you promised us is not enough and, of course, it is very important for you to put pressure on a joint neighbouring country of ours, the Czech Republic, which, as far as I understand it, would prefer to not take part in any kind of more critical test, in particular, with regard to crimes.
As pointed out by the amendments tabled by our group, military intervention or any sort of military approach to conflict resolution, with the alleged aim of stabilising certain regions or countries, is the wrong track.
As nuclear energy will remain part of the Member States' energy mix in the future it is important that such a report is adopted successfully in the plenary session of this Parliament.
I voted in favour of Mrs Serracchiani's report on the conclusion of the agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because I believe it would represent a highly beneficial exchange for both parties.
At the Council meeting on 12 May 2011 the Presidency plans to initiate discussions on the various ideas on the Schengen acquis which have been put forward by the Commission in its communication on migration of 4 May.
However, when I look at how the political will has been lacking, how the corporate interests have interfered and how the WTO has procrastinated, what I see before us are recommendations that dilute the original proposals put forward at such short notice by the Commission.
In order to do this, it is important to improve the collection of information about forests, increase research, and especially to encourage Member States to exchange knowledge and experience, starting from a cross-border perspective.
As a Bulgarian politician, I am following with particular interest the developments concerning the intermediate category of beneficiary regions, which is planned to be created in the new 2013-2020 budget framework.
In the communication, the Commission suggests various new initiatives in several priority areas for further action to be taken.
The relevant information could provide an extremely valuable basis for the purposes of environmental policy making.
The message has been extremely muddled and fraught with consequences, including for Spanish producers, but not just for them, since others have been affected too.
The text negotiated by the right wing majorities in Parliament, Council and the Commission puts too much emphasis on short term, severe cuts to deficits, not long term growth.
When it was tabled for debate in committee, it was further shaped by a procedure of 50 compromise amendments, from all the political groups and areas represented in Europe. I am therefore certain that this report represents Parliament's opinion as to how we can help forests, how we can help our communities to adapt to climate change.
Personally, I am particularly in favour of implementing the European tax on financial transactions as quickly as possible, if we cannot have an agreement at world level.
'GDP and beyond - Measuring progress in a changing world' is a report that aims to assess levels of progress in the European Union through gross domestic product, which has taken on the role of a comprehensive indicator for societal and economic development.
We see room for using synergies and avoiding duplications, making things simpler and ensuring that there is clear added value for whatever we do at EU level.
However, this suggested increase means that the next Multiannual Financial Framework financial perspectives 2014-2020 would represent just 1.11 of EU gross national income GNI, as opposed to 1.06, the sum projected for 2013.
You cannot get a number one position, which is indeed the leader's role, if you are not taking the choices that need to be taken.
The Hungarian Presidency believes in a work-based economy and society, and regards small and medium-sized enterprises to be among its key partners in this.
The rapporteur, Mr Mikolasik, referred to the question of transparency when allocating funds, as a basic prerequisite for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy.
Although the Lisbon strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy place unprecedented emphasis on social policy, competitiveness issues and economic factors continue to take priority over social issues.
It is very important that consumers be informed of the total price and principle characteristics of a given product immediately before ordering.
The labour market increasingly requires mobile, flexible people with international experience.
Furthermore, we need reliable chemical tests to confirm that textiles created meet hygiene and environmental criteria.
The aim of the Commission's proposal to repeal Council Regulation EC No 154198 on proof of origin for certain textile products and to amend Council Regulation EEC No 303093 on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries is to simplify the legislation in force with a view to creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses, mainly with respect to the simplification of customs formalities carried out by importers of certain textile products released for free circulation in the Community.
It should be noted that the cause of the disaster was the breakdown of the cooling system due to a power outage, and interruptions to power supply are a frequent phenomenon in the Member States.
I support this proposal for the committee to continue its work on this important document on the basis of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading, and I hope that the Council will also take a favourable approach towards promoting access to information about textile products.
I voted for the report because I agree that, in order to ensure closer coordination of economic policy and sustained convergence of the behaviours of Member States' economies, the Council should go ahead with multilateral supervision as an integral part of the European Semester for the coordination of economic policy, in line with the objectives and requirements provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU. Parliament shall be duly involved in the European Semester, in order to increase transparency, ownership and accountability of the decisions taken, specifically through economic dialogue. I agree that the Economic and Financial Committee, the Economic Policy Committee, the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee should be consulted within the framework of the European Semester wherever deemed appropriate, and that the relevant stakeholders, in particular the social partners, should be involved in the European Semester as regards the main political issues, wherever appropriate, in accordance with the TFEU, with the law and with national policies.
I think that European citizens need to have a better understanding of the cohesion policy's objectives. A strong Europe, which is a Europe that will cope with the global competitive environment, is achieved by maintaining the cohesion policy as a key element in EU policies, aimed at achieving balanced development in every region. I want to insist on maintaining a significant proportion of the future budget outlook for the cohesion policy.
Mr President, Chernobyl has been a point of reference for European policy for the 25 years since the tragic disaster.
It is a vital habitat for the conservation of numerous rare fauna and flora species, as a nesting place of globally threatened birds, and as a depositary of significant archaeological and traditional heritage.
This optional instrument would stand alongside Member States' contract laws as an alternative option which the contractual parties would be free to choose.
First, the IMF has played a key role, in cooperation with the European Union, in overcoming the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, for which Dominique Strauss-Kahn made a major contribution as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund.
He got loans, services, advisers and the breadth of things that could make a difference, so I think that it is a good model.
We would like to see this Green Paper having a short and long-term impact through specific developments at European level in such areas as taxation adapted to on-line cultural goods and services and the possibility of exploiting the financing facilities available through the EIB and the EIF.
Fifth, we will encourage Russia to deepen cooperation in our common neighbourhood and continue the dialogue on other topical international issues like the Middle East, for example, or North Africa.
In addition, I ask the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative that, when she launches or opens this investigation into the situation in Camp Ashraf, that she also investigate the human rights abuses being committed against the population by the Mujahedin, which have been witnessed and documented by organisations such as Human Rights Watch.
I should therefore like to advise Mr Verhofstadt, because he has obviously been misled, that on these two issues, which form the cornerstone of the reforms, Nea Dimokratia has not only agreed; it was Nea Dimokratia that made the proposals.
The external auditor has pointed the finger at weak budgetary planning, the lack of a clear link between objectives and budgetary resources, as well as carry-overs and cancellations of significant appropriations.
However, I think that as part of future cooperation between the Union and Ukraine, instruments should be created which, in the longer term, would contribute to a strengthening of the rule of law in Ukraine. I have in mind, here, the idea of creating, for example, an advisory group to help bring Ukrainian law closer to European standards, and assistance in various areas of law, including the training of judges, for example. I think Ukraine's European aspirations, which, on the one hand, are hedged around with conditions, should, on the other, show a willingness to help in this. I hope the Polish Presidency of the Council of the European Union will adopt such a stance.
Despite this, I do think it is important for the European Union to seek the application of the International Labour Organisation's rules and agreements in international treaties with third countries, because it seems to me, as we learn more about the labour market and working conditions in Asia, Africa and other corners of the world, that we must strive to ensure that significant improvements are made in the status of workers in these regions and areas too.
We have in Frontex a European tool par excellence which is essential for controlling our external borders.
In March and June 2010, the European Council adopted the Europe 2020 strategy, the main priority of which is enhanced coordination of economic policy strategies in the Member States and, as a long-term goal, sustainable and inclusive growth and sustainable employment.
Is this the right signal to be sending out at a time when funding for other research projects, in particular for renewable energy, is being cut We want to take seriously the claims made by the Commission and the European Union that they really intend to combat climate change and to move towards the use of renewable energy, but then we see that the funding for this project is given such a high priority and we believe that this is the wrong decision.
More generally - as other fellow Members have reiterated - the Commission's Communication on the EU strategy on the Rights of the Child states that, in 2009, more than 6 million young people dropped out of the school system, having barely completed lower secondary education and, of these, 17.4 did not go beyond primary school.
In the Committee on Budgets, we are working on firmly implanting the Europe 2020 flagship in the European Union's strategy through an independent financial framework.
That is what has been happening and, in my opinion, it has been disastrous not only for Schengen but also for the European Union and its image because the reintroduction of internal border checks contradicts the whole essence of the Union and the basic principles of the Treaty.
By way of conclusion, I would briefly like to emphasise the following let us make use of all this positive energy that we have here in the European Parliament, the temple of European democracy, as well as in the European Commission, and let us do everything to ensure this report does not remain merely a dead letter.
Instead of looking at the short term, we need to take action in support of better protection for our external borders, of signing and complying with readmission agreements with our southern and eastern neighbours, and of solidarity with those Member States which are subject to the strongest immigration pressure in southern Europe.
Achieving social, economic and territorial cohesion is one of the important objectives of the European project.
I also want to put a question to all the Members of this Parliament can you say that this economic governance package is worse today than when it arrived here Can you say that no improvements have been made to it by this House You cannot say that, because it is not true.
Madam President, so we are to have a transparency register Unsurprisingly, this has only come about because enterprising British journalists were able to demonstrate the ease with which some MEPs succumbed to the lure of money.
In view of this, it is important that the regions that are already out of Objective 1 be able to go through an intermediate phase that consolidates the development of which they have already shown themselves to be capable, instead of being abruptly abandoned, thus jeopardising the progress made in the meantime.
The complainant's lawyer in Sweden has reportedly stated that the ladies themselves cannot tell if the acts in question constituted rapes, because they are not lawyers.
I am voting for this proposal, as pre-school end early-childhood education are provided in accordance with various traditions throughout the European continent, making the creation of a universal European system for early-childhood education difficult.
These problems require harmonised action at EU level so that young people are better prepared for the labour market.
The new Hungarian constitution is an important instrument for clearing away the ruins left by eight years of corrupt and inept Socialist governance.
I voted in favour of this resolution, because a well-functioning procurement market is particularly important for fostering the Single Market and stimulating innovation.
According to 'Save the Children', the Indian non-governmental organisation, an estimated 60 million children still work today in fields, restaurants or factories in India. I deplore the fact that the conservative majority in the European Parliament has refused to face up to this state of affairs by rejecting an amendment which highlighted the European Parliament's concerns over the use of children for work, children who are frequently exploited in dangerous and unhealthy conditions.
The recent financial crisis has highlighted the three main problems involving credit rating agencies lack of competition, due to the scarce importance of rating agencies in global capital markets, as well as the inability to compete, particularly in terms of regulatory standards; over-reliance on external ratings in the regulatory framework for formulating standards, laws and regulations for example, their increasingly frequent use in determining capital requirements as well as Central Bank reliance on external credit ratings; and, lastly, the absence of liability for credit rating agencies in relation to the ratings they provide, in which regard the report also proposes to foster the establishment of a European network of credit rating agencies.
It includes graduated public funding that reflects employment and environmental considerations, the fact that agriculture produces public goods and the concept of active farmers.
the oral question to the Commission on the crisis in the European fisheries sector owing to higher oil prices, by Philippe de Villiers and Juozas Imbrasas, on behalf of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group - B7-03082011,
That is one of the positive elements. I am no enthusiast, but I did defend this in my group because we now have an important principle - the internalisation of external costs - incorporated into European legislation for the first time.
But now, after churches were burned and Christians killed in a renewed wave of attacks, the time has come for the EU to make it abundantly clear to the Egyptian authorities that they are responsible for the internal security of the country and for the protection of the rights and livelihood of all Egyptian citizens.
Equal access to the European Union's waters and resources is one of the basic principles of the common fisheries policy.
Rear-mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors 
We need to safeguard farmers' welfare and strengthen local economies.
The background to the action plan is the general deployment of global satellite navigation systems and, specifically, the development and deployment of EGNOS European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, the forerunner of the Galileo system.
The Union must apply the same criteria to all Member States, including when it comes to joining the Schengen area.
It is very important that a report such as this one has been produced and that we should also aim to consider companies in remote areas in the north, for them to be able to compete on an equal footing with other European companies.
Investment in transport, our energy networks and broadband expansion, particularly in our regions, will all boost jobs and growth.
If a country like Belgium wishes to ensure that Europe is not allowed to make decisions on Belgium's behalf in the future, then it is high time to demand that those responsible for federal policy should recognise their responsibilities to their citizens, instead of intervening with the Commission for the retention of the index or of social policy in Belgium.
Moreover, do we want governments that comply with the Stability and Growth Pact I think we do. Thus, managing sanctions is necessary.
We need EU-level powers of decision and action on major issues, but we also need the honesty without which mutual trust is impossible.
The decision to include these two countries, which joined the EU in 2007, in the Schengen area will have to be taken unanimously in the Council by all the governments of all the countries already belonging to Schengen.
Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that, in advance of the next General Assembly of the International Labour Organisation ILO, we can debate this welcome initiative of the ILO proposing to the Member States of this organisation a convention supplemented by a recommendation on domestic workers.
It would be usual for the European legislative to be consulted when an international negotiation mandate is involved, in a situation where the European Parliament has a relevant role to play in terms of shaping EU-level investment policies.
For the same reasons, I believe that a multicultural, multilingual and practical education is essential for shaping the citizens of the future, especially if this is achieved by means of mobility schemes such as Youth on the Move.
In Austria, we have a saying if you do not pay up, the band does not play.
Chair of the INTA Committee.
With reference to fuel prices, in order to address this situation, the Commission encourages the Member States to use fully the possibilities offered by the European Fisheries Fund.
Commissioner, on behalf of the entire Parliament, I would like to thank you for agreeing to conduct this debate in the run-up to this conference.
Our objective is to be in a position to meet the challenges which, let us not forget, threaten the very existence of mankind on this planet.
We can also remember how well representation of the Union worked in the World Trade Organisation or in the Food and Agriculture Organisation.
I would add that Directive 200078EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation does not exclude domestic workers, so no amendment is needed for the ratification of the ILO Convention.
Besides, import authorisations, ex post statistical surveillance systems and the requirements of single administrative documents already ensure that imports are effectively controlled in the Union.
I want to acknowledge the constructiveness of the proposals and the debate, which I feel has been sufficiently vibrant and has fully expressed the mosaic of viewpoints which unite the European Parliament. I think that we come out of this debate, in any case, in a much richer position as a House and with a much improved political profile.
The Commission will also commit itself in this declaration to reviewing the intergovernmental nature of the European Stabilisation Mechanism by mid-2014.
I agree that we should never forget the Chernobyl disaster.
It is now down to the Commission to take up Parliament's ambition, presenting its proposals for the next European financial framework and not falling victim to the restrictive budget policies of Member States.
The Commission should, therefore, respond positively, with short- and long-term measures, to tackle the adverse conditions faced by the sector and the serious losses in income being experienced by our fishers.
This approach will make the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set for a particular country compatible with the holistic, global treatment of each industrial sector, thus preventing carbon leakage.
Sometimes, quite rightly, we focus on improving conditions for current workers, but disregard in public debate what we need to do to bring new workers into agriculture so that our production will be assured and improved, in view of the fact that the countries that have lent most support to young farmers are least exposed to land abandonment.
As far as I am concerned, the European Parliament's operating budget is in keeping with the financial climate.
I voted in favour of Mr Falbr's report because I consider that the promotion of corporate social responsibility in Europe needs to be increased, in a bid to respond directly to the need to defend common values and to increase solidarity and cohesion between Europeans.
As is mentioned in the resolution, the European Parliament has received more than 400 petitions on the subject of widespread misleading trading practices by publishers of business directories which affect thousands of businesses, mostly small ones.
The Treaty of Lisbon lays the foundations for the European Union to establish itself as a credible and influential player on the international scene.
According to current estimates, global navigation satellite systems are expected to earn the European economy between EUR 55 and 63 billion over the next 20 years.
Overall, I believe that the legislative package which has been presented is an appropriate response to the global crisis and the EU's current economic situation, building on the relevant legislation and complying with the Europe 2020 strategy and other strategic EU documents, and therefore I recommend adopting it in the amended version.
Indeed, projects should not be drafted in order to take up the funds available, but rather to meet strategic objectives.
Ongoing, well-structured dialogue between universities, research centres and businesses can enable a real link to be established between employers' requirements and the skills acquired during education and training cycles.
By passing this report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework by 468 to 134 with 54 abstentions, the Parliament confirms that it is living in a different world from the harsh economic reality of our times.
It is important for the EU to respect the right of self-determination of these people without any restrictions and to recognise the results of the referendum as an expression of the democratic will of the people of South Sudan.
We stress, therefore, that those efforts require fair, impartial and independent legal proceedings.
The textile and clothing industry in particular is in a time of crisis in a number of Member States as a result of transformation.
This goes for the whole of the Horn of Africa and not least for the Swedish citizen, Dawit Isaak, who is imprisoned in Eritrea.
Any change to the own resources system also requires all Member States to give their approval in order for it to enter into force.
Information given to consumers, the medium on which this information is stored, goods of diminished commercial value and the possibility to return goods are particularly important issues today.
Often, and especially in urban areas which stand out thanks to problems of social exclusion or environmental pollution, ESF resources could be used to support local projects to prevent exclusion that are carried out in a coordinated and united way by public authorities and private businesses acting as leaders to a network of cities. I hope that today's vote encourages better harmonisation of rules for particular EU funds and programmes under which urban and local development projects are eligible for cofinancing in order to minimise red tape and potential errors in implementation as far as possible.
That is the objective of the economic governance package, of which this report by my fellow Member Mrs Goulard is a part.
Mr Barroso, I have a question to ask you that relates to the grave situation in which we, in the European Union, find ourselves. 2008 was the year of a deep crisis in banking.
It is not a luxury but a necessity to sustain and foster Europe's attractiveness in a globally connected and competitive environment.
The report adopted in plenary today includes a broader package of measures that constitute the proposals for European economic governance.
Research and innovation are central to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, so investment in RD is the best possible response.
Mr President, yes, it is a very simple oral amendment replacing the word 'harmonisation' with 'cooperation' since this is more appropriate and more precise as we are talking about vocational training.
We would have preferred to lighten the penalties, but we had to agree to them as part of the compromises.
My next point is that we have just seen that investment in research and development largely ends up in the twelve 'old' Member States, so further distribution is required. A re-balancing is needed.
The process of assessing the impacts of a regulation contributes significantly towards reducing the bureaucratic burden that is a by-product of statutory regulation. A special Impact Assessment Board was set up at Commission level some time ago, and it assesses impacts both ex ante and ex post.
It is important for the European Union to express a unanimous and strong position that is conveyed not only by the various Member States, but also by the Commission, and you have pledged to do that, Commissioner.
This will increase and not reduce the amount of administrative work and the result will be that expensive, new, decentralised agencies will be established.
This distrust features in the reports from the European Commission on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, in the reports from Europol and in a series of statements made by senior representatives of various Member States.
I voted in favour of the report on the external dimension of social policy, promoting labour and social standards and European corporate social responsibility.
In this case, devising a common EU-level fisheries policy, aimed at protecting the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources is an absolutely natural concern.
In this sense, giving a financial dimension to the Europe 2020 strategy brings into play and gives a central role to our consistency and credibility.
We should, in fact, have administrative sanctions for minor offences rather than the criminal system that is currently employed in my own country.
This forced the governments of both the Member States and the United States to inject public funds amounting to roughly 25 of gross domestic product GDP into the financial sector.
Transport applications of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems 
The reference for capital announced by the EBA is based largely on the current provisions of the Capital Requirements Directive, which already takes into account the different banking structures and the management models which exist in Europe.
The existence of minimum harmonisation clauses has resulted in the fragmentation of the regulatory framework, hindering the completion of the single market.
I voted in favour of granting Pakistan emergency trade preferences for textile and other products in the EU in order for these trade preferences not simply to be a purely token measure that filled the pockets of the corrupt elites in Pakistan. I call for effective control over the increased income by democratic trade unions to ensure that the money is directed towards rebuilding schools and hospitals in the areas affected by flooding.
Let me also say that child labour is a very complex matter and it has always been a very complex matter in our own countries. I remember very well that when I was young, which is, of course, some time ago, but nevertheless not ages, a lot of children were still working specifically in agriculture, so this is not something that completely belongs to the Dark Ages in Europe either.
We need more consistency, we need more Europe in the application of these tests, and that is why the peer review with the EBA will also be very useful.
As you know, the Council and Parliament are now negotiating to have the resettlement programme in place, and this is also an area where the European Commission could look at possibilities for financing quite a lot of it. In relation to our immediate neighbourhood across the Mediterranean, in the mobility partnerships we are looking to include all aspects of irregular, legal and international protection asylum under migration.
In actual fact, even old and large Member States have been finding it difficult coping with the flow of emigrants.
These are all problems for the credibility of the tests, but the stress tests are only the beginning.
We therefore run the risk of setting dangerous precedents or, worse still, of making political use of trade preferences that should perhaps follow criteria that are rather more objective, and rather less discretionary and contextual than in this case.
Finally, given the importance of this problem, I call on the Commission to draw up a plan for tackling it at EU level that takes into account the full extent of this problem of combating antibiotic resistance, above all, the link between animal health and antibiotic use, and the link between animal and human health.
It is also desirable that the EMSA set out, in a table to be annexed to the Court of Auditors' next report, a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year, so as to enable the discharge authority to assess more effectively the EMSA's performance from one year to the next.
This is good news not only for people who do not want to buy products that contain real fur or leather, but also for those who suffer from allergies. I am disappointed that this report did not make origin labelling compulsory for textile products, but I am encouraged that the Commission will come forward with an assessment report to address such issues in the future.
However, in the current agreement, we have to say that the car does not seem to be included in the congestion. I am referring to major problems, such as the state of the infrastructure and the fact that things are improving, including in terms of reducing noise or other pollution.
It is now our common responsibility, together with the Council, to translate concretely those lessons into a new set of modern and efficient rules and processes which will enable the Union to meet better the expectations of our 500 million citizens in a sound and cost-effective way.
We also need to reduce labour market segmentation.
Projects such as this can create new impulses for cooperation, the implementation of which will bring benefits not only to Europe, but also to Ukraine, Russia and many Asian countries.
The two concrete questions were about the financial tax and about our position on reverse qualified majority.
Some points that were taken up by Mrs Quisthoudt-Rowohl and others relate to security and fairness.
In doing so, we are also using spectrum as a vehicle for bridging the digital divide and developing new services that are within the reach not only of large telecommunications companies but also of SMEs and start-ups, which will need them. I believe that this economic dimension is essential.
The most effective way we can promote development is to enable people to help themselves. I therefore welcome the abolition of customs barriers - no matter how temporary - and I am confident that this transitional period will allow us to evaluate the process proposed by the Commission.
It is absolutely clear that there is currently a majority of transport ministers in the Council to whom environmental interests are of no concern.
Many of the amendments from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been taken into account by the six-pack rapporteurs.
Yesterday, like today, there is only one true intention to obtain trade concessions that benefit, above all, the big European importers.
Over the past few months, the Commission has carried out consultations on this matter with the Fund's most important stakeholders.
I was privileged to be present in East Timor at the birth of the world's first new state of this millennium. I hope that South Sudan can achieve its independence while averting the tragic transition suffered by the people of East Timor and providing peace and prosperity for the Sudanese people, who have suffered too much during the longest running civil war in Africa.
The work is therefore financially undervalued and is often not considered to be normal employment under labour law, as a result of which workers are exposed to unauthorised and unfair treatment.
Georgia's economy has recovered after Russia's military invasion of 2008, and has done extremely well in comparison to other countries of a similar size in the difficult times of the global financial crisis.
The Commission makes funds for promoting quality products available to operators in order to raise consumer awareness of the system.
The only thing is - and this is prompted by our behaviour in the past - that we must further strengthen the preventive aspect of the Stability Pact, because if a Member State goes down the wrong road, then we cannot allow it to become subject to political bargaining in the Council, which is ultimately what the response from Europe will be.
As many people warned a year ago, the International Monetary Fund-European Union IMF-EU programme for Greece has not only caused economic disaster and social devastation, but it has proved incapable of fulfilling the very objectives that allegedly justified it the deficit reduction targets have not been met, the country's public debt must be around 170 at the moment and the interest rates that the markets require on the public debt have soared.
Mr Itala rightly argues in recital 5 that we must take adequate measures to ensure for a responsible attitude towards our general expenditure allowance. I hope that recital will stay, because it is good for credibility and transparency.
The Commission has been committed to providing leadership in ensuring that the most vulnerable people in crisis have access to safe, adequate and nutritious food.
Precisely in order to facilitate the transition from one stage to the next, the directive introduced a 'flexibility scheme', allowing tractor manufacturers to place on the market a limited quantity of tractors with engines calibrated to the emission limits permitted during the previous stage.
Instances of mis-selling of financial services products, and lack of sufficient support by banks for personal customers and small businesses that find themselves facing temporary liquidity problems, show that more tangible action should be taken by regulators to ensure that operators in the financial services industry support their clients and generally offer better protection to consumers.
We want to introduce a transaction levy as a resource of our own, accepting the challenges and adhering to the Treaty rather than burying our heads in the sand.
The detention camp in Guantanamo Bay is a reflection of this tragic situation.
This point was made several times just now.
The Commission is to send Parliament a first draft of this in the autumn. I think this presents a unique opportunity to make improvements here. I would ask my fellow Members to support this and to work to bring about a reform.
Furthermore, high standards in terms of air safety and security will be applied and these are vitally important to passengers, crew and the whole aviation sector in general.
Given the huge importance of the livestock sector for the European agricultural economy, it is essential to address this issue properly. I agree that the Member States should perform regular systematic surveillance and monitoring of AMR in food producing animals, without creating additional financial or administrative burdens for farmers or other animal owners or veterinarians.
This offers Member States additional opportunities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means a better transport-demand-management instrument.
I voted in favour of this recommendation because I feel it corresponds to the best interests of both parties.
Moreover, Galileo will have the facility to support the implementation of previous traffic management systems for all means of transport road, air, sea, etc., which will improve efficiency and reduce the environmental impact.
However, we must remain realistic.
Secondly what budget is required by a currency union
There needs to be coordination, streamlining and mainstreaming through an interinstitutional taskforce which should report back to the European Parliament.
You have cautiously welcomed the Fatah-Hamas reconciliation, but will you engage in dialogue with Hamas Are we to repeat the mistakes of 2007 As we know, the situation is certainly very complicated.
Currently, there are 2 million people employed by the forestry sector in the EU, mostly in small and medium-sized enterprises, and the sector earns 300 billion per year.
Although we have different opinions about energy production, we all agree, based on the 'polluter pays' principle, that the waste produced in the European Union has to be stored within the EU, even if reprocessing takes place in a third country.
This regulation dealt with the most pressing issues, subjecting CRAs to oversight and regulation.
The proposal that has been made makes it difficult to meet the public's demands and fulfil our responsibility to promote peace, development, international stability and human rights in the world.
Dear Mr. President, I voted in favour of this report because it stresses that the European territorial cooperation, with its significant contribution to the multi-level governance model, is one of the pillars of the cohesion policy.
Then there are the issues that no one wants to address in this House the very low wages paid to drivers, the terrible working conditions and the unacceptable driving times that compromise everyone's safety.
However, we have now taken an important step forwards and we need to push on even further.
It is worth noting that there will be a shift towards industrial and technological development and a corresponding shift away from low-skilled labour.
Why is no one interested in ensuring that foodstuffs are as natural as possible Why do we not pay more attention to our own health and welfare and that of our productive livestock I cannot understand why so little responsibility is shown for the health of children and adults in certain European circles.
In closing, I would just like to say that the IMF must be placed under an obligation to work in the interests of reducing global imbalances and poverty.
Preparations for the European Council meeting 24 June 2011 continuation of debate 
A Europe that belongs to its citizens can only work as a Europe of homelands, subsidiarity and national sovereignty.
We support the accession of Bulgaria and Romania provided that all preconditions are met as is the case, according to the experts' opinion.
Thirdly, we are talking about money from taxpayers, European citizens.
In the Stability and Growth Pact, for which I was rapporteur for the corrective part, it is possible to add the idea of growth to that of stability and budgetary discipline.
On 25 March 2011, the European Council reiterated the strategic importance of the EU-Japan relationship, confirming that 'the forthcoming summit must be used to strengthen this relationship and bring forward our common agenda'. In this regard, the conditions for a successful FTA should be explored on the basis that Japan can demonstrate its willingness to tackle, inter alia, non-tariff barriers and restrictions on public procurement.
The response to these challenges will have to be sought in the Europe 2020 strategy, which should be the policy reference of the next MFF.
We are able to propose an alternative to this austerity model which, as we can see from Greece, is proving to be extremely limited.
There are generally financial reasons behind the current tendency to provide and perform undeclared domestic work, because undeclared work is more advantageous to both parties than officially registered work which, besides tax and deductions, burdens both parties with extensive bureaucratic demands.
In this regard, I hope that the Vice-PresidentHigh Representative will raise the issue of Georgia, parts of whose territory remain annexed and occupied illegally by Russian soldiers, and help also to put pressure on Russia to solve the Transnistria question in Moldova. I also accept that the Commission is now making the suggestion that the EU-Russia Summit should be annual rather than every six months, which is a good idea and the way forward.
The first question is whether we are actually undermining our attempt to establish a multilateral agreement by agreeing a large number of external trade agreements with highly significant trading partners.
Azerbaijan spends countless petro-dollars trying to convince outsiders of the benign nature of the regime but I, for one, am not fully taken in.
The European Investment Bank, which administered these loans for two years, generally did not have information on the implementation of these instruments.
Now we are making progress.
On the subject of sovereign debt, I advocated that the rating agencies should avoid pro-cyclicality in their work and take into account the forecasts of the main international financial institutions. I also called for proposals from the Commission to reform the payment models and to impose accountability for misconduct.
Finally, we call on the Commission to transpose the Union's innovation policy into an action plan with specific objectives and measurable targets.
In the meantime, Europe should keep its watchful eye on Hungary and encourage the Hungarian democrats to regain the initiative.
Brussels, which is considered by some to be second only to Washington as a mecca for lobbyists, needs proper regulations and clearly-defined principles of cooperation between decision makers and representatives of various interest groups.
Last year, a Commission study came to the conclusion that the best option would be a legal instrument governing the criteria for inspections, but no proposal was put forward, although Commissioner Potocnik has said that the implementation of EU environmental legislation is his priority.
Secondly, they are the foundation for lifelong learning, social integration, personal development and employability later in life.
There needs to be a greater commitment to regional policy that is increasingly flexible and integrated with other instruments and programmes.
You said, 'This is not a permanent solution, we will always have access to the waste'. I approve.
We should prioritise just such growth investments, for reasons that include the principle of concentration.
Trade policy cannot ignore failure to respect workers' rights and, therefore, the development of society may continue only after these shortcomings have been removed.
However, we must not forget that exiting the crisis also has European aspects the economic development plan; financial market regulations to prevent this crisis from recurring; the measures currently being discussed on economic governance in the European Union; EU measures which only make national measures more efficient.
With my amendment, I request that the European Commission ensures every proposal is accompanied by an impact assessment.
We must aim to make Europe the best and do what is best for Europe free up spectrum for new services and increased mobile traffic, laying the ground for new opportunities for culture and content, broadcasters and public services within the framework of broadband.
On the basis of our amendments adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the compromise negotiated with the Council contains, in addition to the accounts initially proposed, a requirement for the Commission to report by the end of 2013 and examine extension of the accounts to cover material stocks and not only flows as well as eco-system services.
GDP is an indicator of market economic activity that has become the standard point of reference at the service of the world's decision makers. GDP is a measure of production that does not measure environmental sustainability, resource efficiency, social inclusion and social progress in general. I therefore agree that in the future, other types of instruments should be studied that allow for a greater number of reliable data for measuring a world that is changing.
That is why we want to find a balance within the CAP, rather than pitting food concerns against environmental issues.
The proposal is intended to ensure that, on the one hand, consumers of the 27 Member States can rely on a high level of protection and, on the other hand, that businesses, regardless of their size, can provide their goods and services to consumers in the 27 Member States without facing unnecessary legal obstacles.
As the current directive on misleading practices has turned out to be insufficient, I voted in favour of this resolution calling on the European Commission to speed up the revision of this directive so that such misleading practices can no longer take place.
We have chosen to emphasise the organisational and policy frameworks that are needed for the optimal coordination of culture in the EU's external actions.
Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Hirsch, for her very constructive approach. I have listened to her with great interest because that was actually my dossier 12 years ago. I started to bring about the mobility in training which was not on the agenda at that moment, and I am very glad to hear how strongly Parliament is in favour of developing this essential element in the Europe 2020 strategy. I would also like to say how much we welcome the report, which reinforces and complements the Commission's communication of June 2010.
In both countries, opportunities will be created for business and the manufacturing sector, thanks to the elimination of substantially all imported tariffs and improved market access for services and investors.
However, I would point out that these are lofty aims that will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in reality.
While I consider that we could have gone further by introducing a specific article regulating the indication of origin of textile products, I voted in favour of the proposal for a regulation.
Russia is one of Europe's most important economic partners, not to mention a neighbouring country on which, inter alia, European energy policy depends.
The simplification of eligibility rules and financial processes is a priority objective of the Commission in the perspective of the next Multiannual Financial Framework.
Negative effects of the trade preferences cannot therefore be ruled out, which is why I rejected the report.
Things did not go optimally, but it is done now and we have a solution for the future - but not, unfortunately, for the past.
We have also asked the authorities in Austria to confirm to us that in the event of the future expansion of this or other ski areas which met the criteria under the old version of the Austrian act on environmental impact assessments, screening will first be carried out to ascertain whether an EIA is necessary.
Both belong to the most visible and popular achievements of European integration.
The article concerning rest periods is also problematic.
Despite the fact that work on the simplification of procedures has slowed down during the more than two years spent on this dossier, I would note that Parliament proposed extending the original scope of the regulation, in particular to include provisions concerning the country of origin of textile products, so I am glad that a balanced compromise has been reached. I would point out, however, that my group decided to approve the proposal in its initial version, which provides rapid benefits for business and consumers.
Of course, we should not conclude an agreement at any cost but only if the substance on the table is right.
The truth is that the experts just do not know, but each time such allegations are made, they destroy livelihoods in countries' economies.
Most of all, I would like to congratulate Hungary on its new constitution.
I think it is a good idea as well to enable small enterprises to register themselves as European private companies, thereby reducing the administrative burdens and, at the same time, realising smart regulation is an extremely timely issue. A high priority in this is spreading the 'only once' principle across Europe and examining whether the regulatory framework of certain policy areas is as it should be and, if it is not, what changes are required.
On top of a number of administrative difficulties, European entrepreneurs are too often faced with very diverse contractual regulations in force in the Member States.
This certainly includes the large number of agencies that enjoy an extremely expensive autonomous existence, and agriculture, where some Member States have still not succeeded in introducing a more market-appropriate flat-rate acreage payment scheme.
When we were debating the comments on this report and amendments to it, one of the views expressed was that a directive should be drafted, since some businesses simply do not behave in a socially responsible way.
Thirdly, to ensure that financial institutions make a fair and substantive contribution to the sharing of the costs of the recent crisis, as well as to address concerns about excessive profits.
We also believe the Commission should provide Parliament with a detailed explanation in cases where it considers it unnecessary to assess the impact of its decisions.
The Committee on International Trade did not question any of these things as an obstacle to taking the debate into their own hands and voting on this issue, and took on board all these late changes from both the Commission and the Council.
Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government of Ukraine, who had long been the rivals of President Yanukovych, should not be regarded as collectively, or by association, guilty and responsible for what is perceived as a liability in political practice.
There has been extensive lobbying by Canada to try to prevent us doing this. I have met the Alberta Energy Minister, who has been doing the rounds, as I am sure others have too.
The development of our territories, however, cannot be considered complete unless we genuinely take the urban dimension into account at European level.
I have taken notice of all the speeches that have been made on this report. I would simply like to stress a couple of points.
The Mercosur Trade deal has the potential to seriously undermine European agriculture and the work of European farmers in delivering public goods and high quality, safe food. A quota of the size demanded by Mercosur would completely undermine Ireland's beef production.
by Mr Haglund, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on enforcement measures to correct excessive macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area - C7-02992010 -.
Mr President, thank you for having conducted this debate with as much democracy and generosity as to enable many of my fellow Members to participate.
The Multiannual Financial Framework is a highly political issue that the special committee, working with the Committee on Budgets, has been discussing for over a year. I would like to congratulate the committee on its work. I hope that the European spirit found in the committee will shape the implementation of the framework and take Europe forward for the benefit of our citizens.
In all cases, the intention is the same to prevent countries from protecting their own companies in public procurement, so as to make things easier for the big companies of the powers that also want to use competition, which is seen as the be all and end all, to dominate the awarding of public contracts.
For the majority of people, the origin of the products plays a very important role in their decisions about what they want to spend their money on. In the textile sector, there is a need for a great deal more information in this area so that consumers know where the jumpers, jackets and trousers, etc. that they are buying come from and which materials they are made of. As things currently stand, the labelling requirements are highly inadequate.
Much is expected of the next Multiannual Financial Framework in terms of achieving the aims of the Europe 2020 strategy, encouraging research and innovation, combating the challenges facing the environment, achieving the aims of the European Social, Cohesion and Regional Funds, and fostering education, mobility, training and lifelong learning.
We have learnt from experience and common sense that the solution lies in the debtor country putting its house in order, with the creditors realising that the debt to be paid needs to be arranged to match the relevant country's real ability to pay.
For more than 10 years now, Parliament has been calling for tighter controls, including legislation on European inspections for minimum criteria for inspections in Mr Jackson's report in 1999, for legislative reform for shipments of waste in Mr Blokland's report in 2003, and for minimum criteria for inspections in the 2008 resolution.
However, are there also controls in place in the other direction We only need to think of the latest move from the music industry association to the copyright department.
The diversity that they promote within Member States involves the promotion of the cultures of recent arrivals, which are anything but European.
As regards the objectives of the CAP in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the CAP can contribute to the growth of a sustainable economy by responding well to new challenges and taking account of the diversity and richness of agriculture and the specific characteristics of the 27 Member States.
The financial framework for the period 2007-2013 turned the 'territorial cooperation' objective into one of the three pillars of the EU's cohesion policy, replacing the INTERREG Community initiative.
Terrorism must be condemned and those guilty of this crime must be punished without exception.
They are either missions better performed by NATO, straightforward civilian missions, or they are passive missions involving military personnel.
It is exactly the events of recent months that prove that Europe's most important acquis requires protection and support. I would also like to emphasise that under no circumstances should we bundle two matters here, that is, link the Schengen accession of the two Member States to the matter of the supervision of the Schengen verification mechanism.
That means that, when national governments are wavering due to internal issues, we do not have an instrument that we can activate in order to implement what might be a solution to our problems.
Most of all, the fact should be emphasised that the EU and the Russian Federation maintain permanent relations and that their good relations as neighbours influence stability and security not just within the continent of Europe.
That is why we voted against it.
Now, the Treaties stipulate that Parliament be 'immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure'. Hence, it is essential and legitimate that we ask to be associated with the European Commission and Council during these negotiations.
It is also a pleasure for me to announce that the Council is close to reaching an agreement on the Commission's aims to reduce the costs of establishing a business.
However, the evaluation committee invited Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, largely because they fear migration flows from Turkey.
No policy is viable if it is not backed or, at the very least, tolerated by society, especially a policy which can basically be summarised as a dilemma between exhausting austerity or bankruptcy.
What I expect from you and from the Commission - because it is apparently Commission money we are talking about - is not big plans about changing the Neighbourhood Policy.
When the accession of Hungary and other new Member States from Central Europe to Schengen was hampered by a technical difficulty related to the development of the Schengen Information System, the SIS II, it was the then Portuguese Presidency that helped us with a generous and inventive solution.
We are in favour of this directive on roll-over protection structures on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors.
To achieve this, the review of the Regulation on the European Social Fund will be the opportunity to ensure that this tool is set up for the benefit of the Union's strategy, but also within this strategy of the Union, of course, particularly the objectives for employment and social inclusion.
We cannot have legal migration that works if we do not also work with integration and we cannot fight irregular migration if we do not have a proper and decent return and readmission policy.
The report covers several aspects of the urban dimension of Cohesion Policy such as multi-level governance, partnership principle, sub-delegation of responsibilities, integrated strategic planning and comprehensive financial planning.
We trust that the European Parliament's message will act as a guide and that unanimity will be achieved in the Council so that a final decision can be taken.
People want something that is new and for them, but it is significant. I agree with you about the support and the issues of debt.
In this context, we now have ongoing negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council with a view to establishing a more efficient evaluation system for Schengen.
Public procurement policy should ensure that public money is used as efficiently as possible, and should keep public procurement markets open, thereby contributing to the relaunch of the EU economy, to job creation and to welfare.
Liabilities between the central banks amounting to more than EUR 400 billion have accumulated in the TARGET2 accounts of the European Central Bank system.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 budget of the Clean Sky Joint Undertaking because, despite a number of irregularities in the Undertaking's budget, I think that we can be confident of future improvements in its auditing performance since it is still in the start-up phase.
On 14 April 2011, the Commission adopted a proposal for a decision on the mobilisation of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund EGF in favour of Belgium, with a view to supporting the reintegration into the labour market of workers made redundant as a result of the global financial and economic crisis.
It is a pity, then, that several Member States should have gone to great lengths, since 2008, to strip the proposal for a new Eurovignette directive of its content and to block this dossier.
Pious declarations of good intentions about protecting jobs and workers' and social rights profoundly contradict statements about maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact which has been called 'stupid', including the toughening of sanctions against those countries with more vulnerable economies that have fallen victim to neoliberal policies, and the Euro Plus Pact.
Mr President, this week's European Council has a very substantive agenda.
It has achieved a balanced approach to the most pressing issues concerning the organisation and activities of the European External Action Service EEAS and to key issues for the common foreign and security policy CFSP, such as promotion of the values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, promotion of gender equality and energy security, the situation in Iran and in Afghanistan, the EU response to the democratic changes in the Southern Mediterranean region, and relations with major players such as Russia, China, Japan and India.
Today, mobility essentially concerns students, but it should be encouraged for everyone, young workers and young people who are doing vocational training.
While it is not a good idea to subsidise the fossil-fuel industry, fishermen across the EU are suffering due to the economic downturn and, unlike other modes of transport, they do not have any real alternative to fossil fuels.
The Treaty of Lisbon was supposed to help Europe find a single voice on foreign policy, but last week we saw more proof of the lack of cohesion in EU foreign policy after Osama bin Laden was killed last Monday, the Heads of State of the EU issued no less than five different statements within 24 hours.
It is surely important to recognise informal education as another very important means for improving skills which young people can use in their future lives.
In this connection, we should also consider whether the proposal that the United States is considering is a sensible one, namely, that where only one credit rating agency is chosen by issuers, a second, independent body could be encouraged to give a rating and this second body could be allowed to work on the basis of the information that is publicly available.
The average additional cost to hauliers should not exceed 4 euro cents per vehicle per kilometre, and the least polluting vehicles, driving during off-peak times, would be exempt.
For too long we have operated under the 'gentleman's agreement' originating from 1970, according to which both Parliament and the Council have refrained from examining each other's administrative expenditure.
The negotiation and signing of fisheries partnership agreements is in line with the EU's general objective of maintaining and preserving the activities of its fishing fleet, particularly the long-distance fleet, so the conclusion of this document is crucial to pursuing the foreign policy objectives of the common fisheries policy.
Finally, I fully agree with Parliament's suggestion to the Commission to make the necessary adjustments to the European Social Fund, Erasmus and the Lifelong Learning Programme in order to ensure that funding can be allocated to specific education and training projects, and to projects to tackle youth unemployment and gender discrimination, with more women being encouraged to take part in those projects.
Allow me to convey the appreciation of the Council to the European Parliament for the excellent cooperation. I would like to thank especially the rapporteur, Mr Toine Manders and his colleagues for the highly valuable work they have contributed to this process. I also appreciate the work of the Swedish, Spanish and Belgian Presidencies, because the current result is due to their work of superior quality.
For the above reasons, I voted for this report and I support a European Commission proposal on this matter, which should, in future, involve the European Parliament itself, as well as economic and civil-society stakeholders.
Secondly, I hope that a number of Member States will now really get on with making use of the new opportunities and will also be able to tempt other Member States to join in on the strength of their good results.
It is a strange situation that those countries with large debts to the EU can continue to have money paid out to them and that it can take such an incredibly long time before the money comes back.
For this reason, the European Council decided last week to extend the measures imposed under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement by another six months.
Moreover, I am convinced that in a post-crisis Europe, any Single Market strategy has to be formulated in such a way as to maintain and enhance social cohesion, ensure market integrity and economic sustainability and foster innovation.
We believe that economic governance and national economic policy should be a matter of common concern for all the parties involved, and that there should be an emphasis on early detection and prevention of potentially harmful macroeconomic imbalances.
We need to be able to see, and, where present, substantiate the connections that exist.
It is logical and it requires a logical and rational response from London.
Of course, even now, and probably also in the future, various Member States will find it possible to fund programmes either from the EGF or the ESF and have some kind of room for manoeuvre, but it is very important just to keep the EGF available for all Member States in case there is a need to respond to sudden employment crises.
We must still make sure that we have the resources to implement this protection and information in all the Member States and to take action against offenders.
The human rights violations call for impartial investigation.
Therefore I can say that the European budget, due to its nature, could be the delivery mechanism in a time of austerity to replace the investment cut normally at the national level.
The violent incidents in east Belfast and the murder of Ronan Kerr show how important it is to continue with those schemes which encourage economic and social development on both sides of the border.
In the past, Parliament was merely consulted on such agreements.
On the other hand, the violation of fundamental principles and rights at work cannot be used as a legitimate comparative advantage.
Due to a gradual liberalisation of special sectors water, electricity and gas, in order to protect the enterprises that operate in these areas, we need a qualification system for clients, aimed at ensuring that the competing enterprises are selected efficiently. I am in favour of the motion for a resolution, since it is necessary, in a transparent regime, to keep the fragmentation of EU public procurement law in order to achieve the highest possible levels of competitiveness and efficiency, as set out in our targets.
Indeed, enterprises deserve a leading role in research and innovation, partly because we must remember that EU policies on the subject grew and developed through the promotion of policies aimed at strengthening collaboration between industry, educational systems and research institutions. I therefore believe that the report we have voted on represents a useful contribution to the ongoing debate on a future joint strategic programme to support research and innovation in the EU.
For this reason, I am grateful that our invitation was accepted on a working level and that Ukraine, Russia, Switzerland, Armenia, Croatia and Turkey agreed to take the next step of a joint European stress test, which will allow a safety investigation to be carried out beyond the borders of the European Union.
It is therefore better to have prepared a set of necessary responses in advance, which will make it possible to minimise the risk and avoid further disasters.
Important aspects that should be considered include possible further simplification, adaptation to new challenges such as climate change, and also the right place for the external dimension of the EU's internal policies.
After all, it is in the interests of the Member States which are lagging behind EU research excellence to take advantage of resources from the European Structural Funds to strengthen their scientific and research sectors.
Today we are celebrating Europe Day. I have spent most of the day in Florence which, as you know, is the home of the European University Institute and where the Festival of Europe is taking place. A conference on the subject of the state of the European Union took place there too, and I met students from the European University Institute.
I should like to adjourn the debate a moment to announce that today in the visitors' gallery we have Professor Dagmar Lieblova, President of Theresienstadt Martyrs Remembrance Association, from the Czech Republic, whom we welcome.
That is why it is so important to promote freedom of movement for workers within the Union.
It is therefore crucial for the Common European Asylum System to be completed by 2012 - a system based on high protection standards combined with fair and effective procedures capable of preventing abuse and allowing for rapid examination of asylum applications in order to ensure its sustainability.
The Court of Auditors informed the European Parliament that the Agency's annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular. I agree with the rapporteur that the Agency must set out a comparison of operations carried out during the year for which discharge is to be granted and in the previous financial year so as to enable the European Parliament to assess the Agency's performance from one year to the next more effectively. I welcome the Agency's initiative of launching foresight on the safety and health impact of technological innovations in green jobs by 2020. I believe that the Agency must reduce the increased cancellation rate and inform the European Parliament of the actions taken.
A reformed CAP with a greener first pillar, introducing non-contractual and annual environmental actions that go beyond cross-compliance, and a second pillar more focused on climate action, supported by a professional farm advisory service, could be tailored towards helping farmers to manage their land-use systems so as to contribute to climate action mitigation, and also become less vulnerable to climate change adaptation. That is definitely what we intend to achieve through the next CAP.
This means that businesses take action on a day-to-day basis to protect society and the environment, on their own initiative and irrespective of any legal regulations.
As shadow rapporteur for the Hirsch report on European cooperation in vocational education and training, I would like to explain why I voted in favour of adopting this report.
However, it is essential that we should make numerous further advances, including in relation to the conditions under which prisoners are held and the question of individual standards of legal protection.
The amendments mentioned require the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure to be amended accordingly, which will be done with this report.
Today, we must welcome an important result, which is that we consider the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania to be among those who can benefit from this fundamental instrument.
While recent events have provided a spark of urgency in bringing this matter to the table, the Commission is taking this opportunity, through the communication, to address the long-standing underlying inconsistencies and unresolved issues that have provided scope for some Member States to act unilaterally and not necessarily with a European Union perspective.
As my fellow Members have already said, at least three years have passed, three years during which these people, these hustlers, as they have rightly been called by numerous fellow Members - and I am with them - are misleading colleagues and are misleading small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy.
Where we are today is actually quite impressive because we already have 104 modules that Member States have registered with us and we have their commitment that we can mobilise and deliver assistance in a predictable manner, as long as they do not need these modules to fight the same disasters at home.
Approval of the Presidency's report on the means for promoting Roma inclusion in the European Union and of the conclusions concerning the launch of the EU Strategy for the Danube Region may mark important steps in the implementation of these vital policies for the European Union.
Finally, the request for appropriate sustainability criteria for biomass produced for the use of energy is also important.
We ask for responsibility for what has not been done, for what we have to do immediately, because there is a risk of further infection in Germany at the moment - it has the largest number of people affected - but Spain is not to blame.
Yes, Mrs Wortmann-Kool, that is the crux of the debate as far as we are concerned Let us reduce the deficits, yes, for example by going back on the tax gifts that have benefited the State's creditors above all, but let us do it without sacrificing investment, training and jobs, because today's investments are tomorrow's jobs and the tax income that will follow, and this will allow us to reduce our deficits.
Mr Lewandowski, you have said that a business-as-usual approach is not acceptable.
Among the main advances, I would like to mention two the cooling-off period, which has been extended to 14 days, and provision of the summary containing all the information and the total price to pay before the last button or click which confirms the order.
Cutting funds for culture and education at times of crisis - as my country is doing, on the grounds that culture is not essential to survival - means failing to invest in the future and in smart, inclusive growth; it means failing to understand that culture is essential for life.
Despite the full integration of this new rule, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has been charged with clarifying and consolidating the content of this provision so that it is more readily understandable, particularly in the context of the ordinary legislative procedure.
I should stress the important role played by the EGF in reintegrating redundant workers into the labour market. I call for an assessment to be carried out of the long-term integration of these workers into the labour market, as a direct result of the measures funded by the EGF.
All European citizens have the right to know whether or not those nuclear power plants are actually safe.
However, we just as surely need the Member States to give higher priority to this matter. I think the fact that the Member States are failing in their responsibility to check their compliance with EU legislation is a constantly recurring issue.
Obviously, this should never have been allowed to happen.
Even though this pathogen should not primarily be treated with antibiotics, we have the problem that it is resistant to many common antibiotics.
Some of them see in this nothing less than a kind of cultural imperialism.
This grants the Director of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions discharge in respect of the implementation of the Foundation's budget for the financial year 2009.
Transparency in this process also involves the population in determining the storage site and other details.
It is why I am proposing to support the endowment for democracy which will enable us, too, to use our resources to support opportunities, particularly for young people, to engage in political life, to support the development of political parties, to enable people to do what honourable Members in so many countries represented here had to do themselves - i.e. develop the political process by building those political parties, civil society, and deep roots that mean democracy flourishes and grows.
Furthermore, I support the Court of Auditors' comments regarding the need for improvements in the programming and monitoring of activities with a view to using the available appropriations as efficiently as possible.
The exemptions for EURO V and EURO VI are also positive, as well as the fact that the Member States have again committed to regulating the interoperability of toll systems, as it is a thorn in our sides that that is still not the case.
To enjoy the fruits of an effective integrated market, it is also necessary to tackle the indirect causes that stifle the cross-border aspirations of our fellow citizens.
The role of our agencies is to give us the means to take decisions and to enable our fellow citizens to have confidence in the guidelines that are given.
I am the grandson of a German and feel deep affection for that country, but the German authorities have clearly acted hastily and rashly in this particular case.
It is very important to prevent these charges simply becoming a new tax on heavy goods vehicles, as some Members here have pointed out.
As such, the mid-term review of the current framework programme is crucial so that throughout the second half of its existence, it can contribute effectively to the European economy's recovery.
Tonight, this gives us a chance to influence the Commission in advance of its CSR communication by asking it firstly to maintain the open definition of CSR latterly adopted by it in the Multi-Stakeholder Forum; to return to the principle of convergence in private and voluntary CSR initiatives, which was its former policy; to make concrete proposals for implementing global CSR standards, specifically the updated OECD guidelines on Multinational Enterprises and the new Ruggie framework on business and human rights; to commit to the principle of integrated financial, environmental, social and human rights reporting by business - indeed paving the way towards the possibility of future legislation in this area; and to advance the responsibility of European businesses in their global supply chain, responding to the governance gaps identified in the Commission's own recent Edinburgh study.
The result of this process was communicated to the European Parliament by a letter sent the next day, 21 June. I share the view that during the trilogues the quality of the text has improved a lot, and that the package has become stronger and more coherent.
The review of the system for managing radio frequencies at European level is very important, and I believe that we must clearly prevent the accumulation of frequency rights and the creation of monopolies and oligopolies, which unfortunately exist in some European countries and which are becoming stronger and gaining a foothold in the broadcasting sector.
We can probably put the underlying situation right in the longer term, but it shows how wrong it is to jump to conclusions at a very early point. I can understand the anger - if there is anger and I am sure there is - from the Spanish side and from those who have lost their business.
According to recent figures, 14.4 of young Europeans aged between 18 and 24 years dropped out of school before completing their secondary education, and less than one third of the European Union's population have a higher education qualification, compared with around 40 in the United States and 50 in Japan.
We believe that there is a need to support public research and make its results available in a simple way, without bureaucracy, by promoting productive and business activity, and small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular; the creation of skilled jobs, with rights; social progress and sustainable development.
Intervention during a child's early years is crucial to its future, improving health and family relations, and enabling it to get a better job in the future.
Ultimately, the aim is for people to be able to find a better job, but also, as the explanatory statement says, for them to have 'the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future'.
Ladies and gentlemen, we need to understand that these stress tests are just the beginning of an extensive dialogue on this issue, because only after evaluating the tests will we be able to see the true state of the nuclear power sector in Europe. I am confident that the data from the stress tests will prepare us for a new round of talks on this issue, where we will discuss a new safety policy for the European Union in this field.
As regards misleading practices in business directories, which are common and have a disastrous effect on businesses, I consider it a good sign that the relevant legislation is being overhauled so as to put an end to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely through the creation of a blacklist of misleading practices used by business directories.
The Netherlands, my native country, which I and the other Dutch MEPs have a mandate to represent here, is ready for it; we have already freed up space for the fourth generation mobile Internet.
This is a necessary precondition of a credible and transparent surveillance framework.
Finally, the ban on excessive charges for using certain payment methods and on the use of pre-ticked boxes is excellent news from this directive for consumers.
This is what I wanted to say.
However, although this same goal was not achieved by the deadline, it remains the true purpose of common action.
Underpinned by the need to involve Parliament throughout the process, it is also necessary to draw attention, even if only in general terms, to aspects such as the terms under which information is provided or the stages at which it should be made available.
Starting with the Russia-EU dialogue on human rights and continuing with the summits, I think that a systematic and honest approach is required in cases where the standards for a fair trial are not respected or human rights activists or journalists are persecuted and prevented from doing their job.
However, these people must also be imprisoned.
Given the importance of knowledge-based industries to Europe and our thriving RD sector, we cannot afford to wait until FP8 to take action.
The whole value of our joint and common effort is that we are trying to add a special European value, providing excellence.
As I already announced - and in order to reassure Mr Cancian and all the other honourable Members who have voiced concern about the overly long timescales - I can confirm that we will try to present our work ahead of schedule.
Striking a balance between early warning, on the one hand, and transparency, on the other, is certainly difficult.
We have got to be responsible, and we have got to be responsible as a Parliament as we move towards the legal text that the Commissioner will bring forward in the late autumn of this year.
Parliament has sent a clear message to everyone, and particularly to the Council. I therefore hope that this package will be definitively approved before the summer recess and, above all, applied as soon as possible, so that the European Union is not unprepared, as it was in the past, to rise to the challenges threatening its stability.
Thirdly, the adaptation of rules for participating in new challenges will enable, for instance, greater participation by small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs, and by young researchers in research projects.
Composition of political groups see Minutes
Culture should play a unifying role externally as well as internally, and therefore, in the relations of the Secretariat for Economic Monitoring SEAE, European culture could be the standard-bearer of European values, which, through dialogue with cultures outside Europe, should contribute to peaceful cooperation and constructive understanding between peoples.
We have therefore been advocating the abolition of, or a substantial cut in, national contributions, up to a maximum of 10, so that countries facing major difficulties can make full use of Union funds, and so that the money can be used effectively by those who need it most, instead of being returned to the coffers of those who need it least.
In order to preserve the truth and fairness of such ratings, there is a need to increase the transparency underlying these decisions, as well as the accountability of these agencies. I therefore support and welcome the establishment of priorities for the regulation of credit rating agencies proposed today, which I consider essential in order to overcome the problems in this industry.
Looking to the future of the European capitals of culture, the Commission is currently working on renewal of the initiative beyond 2019.
The report on a New Multiannual Financial Framework MFF for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe is a valuable piece of collective analysis on the future configurations of the EU budget.

Dolly the sheep was neither the first nor the last cloned animal.
The errors are not increasing.
In the short term, we need better practical and pragmatic policy coordination among the EU Member States that are represented in the G20 or G7 or in the IMF. I must say that I have seen plenty of concrete improvement in that regard, so that the EU Member States that are represented in the G20, or in the IMF or in the G7, mostly share common goals and are mostly working together as an orchestra and not with different voices.
Meanwhile, concerning the categories of products falling within Section XI of the Combined Nomenclature that are not subject to quantitative import restrictions and are released for free circulation in the EU, a system of ex post statistical surveillance is being applied to monitor their impact on the EU market.
However, I will mention it here because we need the help of the members of the European Parliament to go back to their constituencies and explain that the European semester is over and national semesters are starting. I think we know what to do; we have country-specific recommendations which are very fair, very honest and very detailed for each Member State, but now we need the cooperation of the national authorities and of the national governments to actually deliver and to carry out the reforms in the Member States.
Mr President, the Commission welcomes Parliament's remarks and suggestions. I am pleased to see that we agree on the majority of issues.
However, the potential for economic cooperation is far from exhausted and I welcome the negotiations in relation to the CETA.
Culture plays an extremely important role in the European Union, which is an area aiming to be 'united in diversity'. First of all, we should stress its undeniable integrationist aspect, which enables the existence of shared areas that is, points at which people with different cultural perspectives find themselves with shared representation.
In my opinion, it was not very clear.
To this end, the motion highlights, in fact, the need for the Commission to fulfil its responsibility of keeping Parliament constantly informed of the progress of its negotiations with non-EU operators.

This report, drafted by Mrs Wortmann-Kool, is on a legislative proposal on economic governance, adopted by the Commission on 29 September 2010, on the surveillance of budgetary positions, and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies, which is part of the economic governance package, adopted by the Commission on 29 September 2010, seeking to 'anchor macroeconomic stability and the sustainability of public finances'. The strengthened framework for economic governance should promote growth and employment, with particular focus on developing and strengthening the single market, and on fostering international trade and competitiveness.
The Commission expects the problem of undeclared work by non-EU nationals to be dealt with in part by the Employers' Sanctions Directive 200952EC, which the Member States have to transpose into national legislation by 20 July this year.
Political decision makers must therefore have at their disposal data that is both reliable and as exhaustive as possible on the modern world and the environmental situation.
Mr President, I think the world-renowned Scottish poet Rabbie Burns might have described this report as a bit of a 'cow'rin, tim'rous beastie' in its original form.
Firstly, we need to have a much sounder basis for the requirement for a proportionality check, so that minor offences are not covered.
We would like the agency to inform Parliament of the actions taken and the improvements made, and we call on the Court of Auditors to conduct a specific audit on the implementation of the European Police College's action plan.
In terms of the efforts to combat illegal trafficking, every state-of-the-art method is used to investigate and collect information. A unique application has been developed in Europe which allows data to be processed in both SIS I and SIS II. The maritime border surveillance system has been presented as a model of good practice.
It is imperative to compensate for the arrival on our market of cheaper wines produced outside the EU with improved access for our products to foreign markets and, in particular, to the Indian market, the growth potential of which is exceptional.
We will abandon the end result until July, and I hope that the Hungarian Presidency, which has proved so successful, will also be able to reach an agreement that satisfies everyone.
It is estimated that 3.7 million jobs can be created by 2020, and that annual gross domestic product GDP can be increased by around EUR 800 billion by 2025.

This agreement is of mutual benefit to the EU and Seychelles on the one hand, is makes a substantial contribution to the stabilisation of the European canned tuna market through the granting of fishing licences for tuna, and thus promotes the creation of 760 jobs in Europe; and on the other hand, thanks to the implementation of the financial contribution's sectoral support, Seychelles is increasing its stock management and fisheries monitoring capacity.
It is nonetheless important to share information with Parliament and the public on the most important issues at stake, given the progress of the negotiations in this instance.

For its part, the European Parliament has been consulted.
For instance, it is estimated that in the near future, it will be possible to achieve geographic locations accurate to 45 centimetres.
Some of these issues are common to all the agencies or some of them, including for example cancellations and delays in procurement procedures, failure to observe Staff Regulations, or the violation of the principle of budgetary annuality.
Rather than pushing for more legislation in the area of immigration and migration, we should be making the legislation that we already have work better and harder for all the citizens of the Union.
Mutual acceptance of certification findings constitutes a massive benefit for the EU, given that it will establish mutual acceptance of certification findings in all areas of airworthiness for all Member States.
The conference focused on the fraudulent practices of business directories and, in particular, cross-border activities.
On this point, I should stress, for example, the impact of direct aid on boosting small farms' profitability and competitiveness.
Essentially, I think that by adopting this measure, Europe has demonstrated that it is further ahead than many Member States, which will clearly have to remedy this situation in short order.
This is yet another enunciation of just concerns and criticisms that, unfortunately, does not get to the bottom of the issues and, for this very reason, ends up being largely inconsequential.
Although this report has some positive aspects, it was not capable of proposing the creation of a public, independent European Credit Rating Foundation.

Europe's cities are its centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, but they must face up to a number of challenges.

In Poland, for example, there is the Konstanty Kalinowski Scholarship Programme, which is operated, among others, by the Centre for East European Studies in the University of Warsaw - an international study centre which enables students from the East and the Balkans to study in Poland.
Acknowledgement from the European Union's missions assessing the smooth operation and connection Romania and Bulgaria have to the Schengen Information System, which operates at the highest security standards, presents a strong argument in this respect.
This motion for a European Parliament resolution on the Report 2010 on the implementation of the cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 encompasses points which are contrary to the principles of our political stance, and it therefore cannot be supported.
The dissemination of the methodology prior to the publication of the stress test results will improve the general credibility of the exercise.
It also mentions the problems many young people have in taking part in mobility programmes for financial reasons, the problem of high drop-out rates from school, and of unemployment and insecure jobs amongst young people.
The Member States are making efforts to reduce their spending; at European level too, we need to be able to target the financial resources available to us towards genuine priorities and added value for Europe. I think that, in this way, Mr Kelly, we can justify a substantial budget for the common agricultural policy by mentioning the positive contributions that this policy makes to European society, not just in terms of agricultural production for the markets, but also in terms of non-marketable production - products which are not paid for by the markets.
We must now learn that carrying the burden of the banks' debt is much worse.
The 100th session of the ILO began last week it will focus on a new ILO convention on domestic workers, an issue which this House discussed recently.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the financial crisis has particularly emphasised the necessity of innovation in the economy of the European Union and therefore, the Commission's proposals for the 'Innovation Union' are particularly welcome.

Promoting these industries will create significant new opportunities for regional development, local partnerships and possible partnerships with the private and public sector.
The agriculture sector must be innovative and competitive, and those working in my own country remain committed to playing their valuable role in the wider European sector.

Amongst the most important aspects, we would stress the need for a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the reasons for the inadequate achievement of the objectives regarding development cooperation and the various lines of support for the fisheries sector in Mauritania; the advocating of support for the fastest possible construction of adequate facilities for landing fish along Mauritania's central and southern coastlines, including Nouakchott, so that fish caught in Mauritanian waters can be landed at national ports rather than outside the country, as is often the case at present; and that fisheries agreements between the EU and third countries should be preceded by a wide-ranging debate in the countries concerned, allowing participation by the public, civil society organisations and national parliaments, thereby promoting greater democracy and transparency.
In monitoring compliance with the rules on budgetary discipline, consideration should also be given to social downturns which may have an impact on the financial position of governments.
There is clearly a conflict of interest in its mandate, and now the euro zone is suffering the consequences.
This is the reason why I voted in favour of it. The EU can make a powerful contribution to the peace and prosperity of our planet.

Fellow Members, the question of what is included in the constitution of a country and what is dealt with at a different legislative level by a certain Member State is something that is quite clearly a matter of national sovereignty.
The common agricultural policy should be based on two pillars, the first one being full funding from EU sources.
Mr President, I would say to the Commissioner that, in recent years, innovation has become a symbol of a policy instrument that can fix all our problems.
The negotiation and conclusion of fisheries partnership agreements is in line with the EU's general objective of maintaining and preserving the activities of its fishing fleet. I am voting for the adoption of the protocol on the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe as this relates to the development of relations with a third country in a spirit of partnership and cooperation, with a view to reinforcing sustainable fishing outside Union waters while taking due account of environmental, social and economic factors.
The role played by local education institutions, as well as local and regional authorities in the area of education and mobility, is also very important, which is why I believe it is important to support the mobility of teachers and youth and education workers, since they are the ones who can motivate youth.
The Vice-PresidentHigh Representative VPHR should be authorised to draft guidelines for regular consultations between the ambassadors of the Member States and the EU ambassadors, especially between those working at a multilateral level in places like Geneva and New York, so that the EU can successfully pursue its UN agenda and meet the expectations of UN members regarding its ability to act.
However, having an effective European foreign policy and our own defensive capabilities without having our own intelligence service and a facility for gathering information is like having a house without a roof.
We need to organise ourselves in such a way that we can respond to the major challenges posed by 2020. I do not believe that this can be achieved from your position, Mr Ashworth; instead, I would back Mr Boge, who I believe is correct and faithful to the Treaty when he says that we need to have the courage to return to a system that involves what are genuinely our own resources.
Show them, Madam President, that Christian refugees in Cyprus are entitled to celebrate mass in their churches.

I have concerns about the provision of a review clause which will ask the Commission to investigate the possible introduction of a number of labelling requirements which have little added value and would place unacceptable burdens on businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises.

They are faced with major challenges, including fluctuations in the price of raw materials, high production costs and low income levels.
We are particularly pleased that there is support for small farms, which are fundamental because they are of great importance both for protecting the land and for the quality of the products produced on them.
They must include the operators' evaluation of their own nuclear power plant and the conclusions drawn by the operators on the basis of the inspection criteria and the consequences of Fukushima.
The last two years have involved many retrograde steps and blocks to progress in the country.
If we want Parliament to play its role of discharge authority seriously, the MEPs must be given access to more comprehensive and detailed information on the budgetary and financial management of the agencies.

New pan-European investments are needed to boost European-level added value by acting as a catalyst for further private investment and by creating economies of scale.
This is how we made the transition from the growth models of the 1950s, according to which the economy sooner or later stabilises and loses its momentum, to the endogenous growth models of the 1980s, in which technology and the design of constantly different and innovative products allow the economy to maintain a positive growth rate over the long term.
On the contrary, they serve the interests of the banks, which have knowingly kept toxic bonds subject to large-scale international speculation on their books, and the interests of large corporations which have found, in the common market, a haven for speculation and tax evasion. I would mention, by way of example, the German company Hochtief, which manages Athens Airport; it has not paid a euro since 2001 and owes EUR 500 million in VAT.
On the accession of Bulgaria to the EU on 1 January 2007, weaknesses remained in the areas of judicial reform and the fight against corruption and organised crime.
At the same time, this method also enables the Member States to generate resources to reinvest in the transport system in order to make it more sustainable so as to actually reduce these external costs.
Finally, I should like to emphasise that the adoption of this report comes at an ideal time, for it has enriched the debate on the future of cohesion policy 2014-2020. Indeed, the European Commission will shortly publish its proposals with a view to updating and therefore improving this policy.
We consider it to be an essential outcome of this package, but this means it must be applied symmetrically.
Rather than suffer a brain-drain as its best and brightest people seek economic migration, what Tunisia requires is EU financial assistance for economic development programmes promoting work for the young and the unemployed.
Innovation means creating synergies and an integrated approach between the different sectoral policies in order to achieve the optimal result for growth and development on the ground.
I do have one doubt, which we have expressed by voting to adopt the amendment removing the wording on the creation of an intermediate category for cohesion policies in those parts of Europe where gross domestic product GDP falls to between 75 and 90 of EU GDP.
As you well know, Parliament and the Council have to assess it at second reading, but the European Commission intends to seize back the policy initiative and reinvigorate it. In other words, the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship intends to start work immediately on ensuring the protection of our products, for the sake of the competitiveness of our businesses and the health of our citizens.
Yes, it is essential to prevent the death sentence being imposed on Mr Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and on many others, but we could have condemned more strongly the position of the United States in this regard, while regretting, at the very least, the change in attitude on the part of President Obama, particularly with regard to military tribunals.
Every link in the European innovation chain must be strengthened and innovation policy must be focused towards challenges.
I am in favour of opening an office of the kind you have described in Libya, because you as High Representative, the Union itself, and Parliament as an independent body, all have credibility in humanitarian and political terms.

I think that accession to the Schengen area is not a gift being offered to Romania, but rather recognition of its merits and efforts, and will be an obvious asset to the security of the EU's external borders.
Let us recall that in the final analysis, fiscal solvency requires stabilising and then reducing the government debt ratio - i.e. achieving a primary structural surplus and achieving a debt-stabilising level.
the report by Markus Pieper, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, on the Commission's fifth Cohesion Report and the strategy for post-2013 cohesion policy;
The draft text of the rapporteur broadly met the position of our group on objective 3.

Young people are tomorrow's decision makers, and it is vital that they are able to develop the competences, skills and knowledge today that will allow them actively to contribute to the growth and sustained future of the European Union over the coming years and achieve the goals set out in the EU's growth strategy.
It constitutes one of the most serious attacks on their sovereignty, and this situation will be even worse for those in the euro area considered to have excessive deficits, which, in addition to continuous surveillance by the European Commission, could be subject to sanctions.
Finally, I fully agree with the idea that it is necessary to set out an action plan for the EU's outermost regions, and multisectoral principles should be established which support their harmonious development and help to reduce the territorial disparities with other European regions.
If we have that, then we will get results.
First and foremost, it is about building on the SME base, which is the main generator of wealth in Europe, through venture capital, guarantee facilities, assistance with loans and simplification of the legislative environment.
The purpose of the SBA has been to reduce the administrative burden of doing business and improve access to finance for SMEs.
What is the current situation Only one in four businesses trade across borders and those who trade limit their operations to only a few Member States.

Mrs Gomes, Romania is part of the European Union and should not be confused with the countries which we discuss in this Chamber every Thursday.
The comments were about the intolerance of Islamist regimes towards Unbelievers. 2. No debate was allowed before the votes on this issue, which affect the fundamental rights of an MEP. 3.

The issue of migration has come to the fore in recent months, particularly under the pressure of recent events in the southern Mediterranean.
Thus, the European Commission, despite being represented within the management boards, reminds us, on the subject of the accounting errors made by the European Police College CEPOL, that an agency is 'an entity with its own legal personality and has a fully administrative autonomy, which includes financial autonomy.' Yet the management board sometimes delegates sole administrative responsibility to the Executive Director.
Why is it, therefore, that we are still talking about the reversed qualified majority I want to make a simple point.

Even so, I should like to draw your attention to the following, Mr Caspary what will benefit our industry the most A path towards zero in the very long term, or a rather drastic reduction in the first few years I believe that we actually need to strike a balance between the two and then see where it takes us.

Madam President, the position is exactly as colleagues have pointed out. I know this because in my own constituency, particularly in Cork, a company called the European City Guide has been fraudulently engaging with businesses all over the place.
Among the intended cost-saving measures, it has been decided that an interpretation service will automatically be provided for meetings of working groups in six languages only French, German, English, Polish, Spanish and Italian, whilst other languages will only be made available if Members request them.

I do not think that we would be having this debate if everything had gone well.
Madam President, I would echo group colleagues and other colleagues in adding my own congratulations to our rapporteur.

We have another resolution full of contradictions before us. On the one hand, the appointment of the new Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises SME Envoy by the Commission is to be welcomed, and his mandate to monitor the progress of the Member States in the implementation of the Small Business Act SBA and to promote SMEs' interests throughout the Commission, ensuring, in particular, that the 'Think Small First' principle is being applied effectively, is to be supported.

It refuses to implement the financial transaction tax and Eurobonds and its eyes are glued on the rating agencies, which did not see the subprime crisis coming, which shows just how reliable they are.
I particularly agree with the rapporteur's assertion that synergies and coordination do not imply one-size-fits-all solutions, but call for close strategic coordination between instruments, policies and actors in order to produce carefully designed interventions and programmes which take into account the territorial specificities and comparative advantages or special features of each region in an integrated place-based approach.

No matter what eventual format we find, I think this question of management will be very important in influencing the final arrangements. I am not speaking about names, but about the need for a separate fund and the need to pay attention to speed in particular.
This despicable report maps the EU's strategic aim to come out on top in the competition for the monopolies with other imperialist centres, by promoting the integration of education into the quantifiable targets of the reactionary EU 2020 strategy which need to be 'transformed' into national targets.
Meeting the 30 reduction target in carbon emissions by 2020 is a priority. I support the initiative in favour of replacing the current car fleet with environmentally-friendly vehicles, given the small distances travelled, which is appropriate for the battery life of electric vehicles.
