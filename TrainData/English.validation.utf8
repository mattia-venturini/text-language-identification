In effect, however, you are betraying one of the most important principles of the Treaty of Lisbon, namely Article 42 'The Union shall respect the equality of Member States before the Treaties as well as their national identities, inherent in their fundamental structures, political and constitutional'. If you have not organised or will not organise debates concerning the states I have mentioned above, or failed to remember here, in the European Parliament, that the socialist government of Hungary blatantly ignored the right to assembly in 2006, then you, ladies and gentlemen, are using double measures.
The sugar plants played an important role in the agricultural sector, particularly in Ireland, where there were processing plants in Cork and in Carlow, and it could be argued that the reform put an end to the sugar sector in Ireland.
Given the importance of such agreements, especially in terms of guaranteeing better services for passengers and new opportunities for operators, it is a good idea for Parliament to inform the Commission of its concerns and its assessment criteria at the outset, without waiting until the negotiations have been concluded.
I hope that aid levels will not decrease, but rather will increase wherever possible, and that ways for it to effectively benefit the most deprived populations will be studied.
I believe, however, that it falls short in one important area, in that it fails to answer the fundamental question asked by our taxpayers and our consumers who pay for the common agricultural policy what are the direct decoupled payments for That is a fundamental question that we all need to face up to. There is no longer any linkage with food production because they are decoupled.
For example, in the case of Greece, the Memorandum stipulates the following 'The government shall ensure that company-level agreements take precedence over sectoral agreements, which, in turn, take precedence over occupational agreements.
Indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs 
Mr President, for the Committee on Development, this is not just a clear report, but a vital one as well, because it establishes that the European Union will be shouldering its responsibility for the poorest countries during the next seven years and that it will therefore make appropriations to this end in the budget.
The Council has been quite clear that in cases where preventive detention is inappropriate, the European Arrest Warrant should not be used.
Instead of a relatively open, transparent and criteria-based process, what do we have A series of caucuses bringing together Heads of State or Government who say to each other, 'I would definitely put forward such and such a person'. That does nothing to enhance the European Union's credibility.
We therefore welcome the Commissioner's cautious approach to this issue and we call on Parliament as a whole to follow that approach, which inspired our group's motion for a resolution.
This is unnecessary and may damage the legitimacy of this powerful EU mutual recognition tool.
According to this evaluation, and in line with the trends of recent years, there has been a reduction in the reference tonnage.
Likewise, I consider unacceptable the lack of investigation of the former Director in relation to his responsibilities concerning College appropriations that have been used to finance private expenditure.
Following very fruitful cooperation between the three institutions, I believe we have reached our common objective, namely, the establishment of this framework regulation on European environmental economic accounts with its first set of three modules, which cover air emissions accounts, environmentally-related taxes or levies and material flow accounts.
The reform of structural policy for the 2007-2013 programming period led to the separation of rural development from the general framework of the Structural Funds.
This is really about political consistency within the European Union, and about a serious structural trend, namely, the rise in the price of oil on account of its scarcity - and every one of us here knows that it is here to stay.
This means that safety nets should be reinforced at times when most needed as we have seen in the past couple of years, while money would be saved in good times.
His stage was the ruins of the devastated national library in Sarajevo; his audience consisted of a small group of people who had remained, despite the siege of the city, and who were listening to his music.
The EU should support the initiatives of young and talented people to promote particular political strategies. A good example of such activity is the website Eastbook.eu, whose founders supply thousands of Internet users every day with information about events in the countries of the Eastern Partnership and the progress of the programme.
Border control ensures that commercial operators supply detailed information during trade operations, guaranteeing, at the same time, the right equilibrium between speed and security of trade flows.
In many specific cases, the Arrest Warrant is not applied in a proportionate way, as we can see in the reports now available to us. Thus, we need to adjust procedures, both in practice and in legislation.
The reason that Greeks are on the streets protesting is that they understand perfectly well what the consequence of this EUIMF takeover will be. The money is not going to ordinary Greek people, it is going to those financial institutions which hold Greek government debt.
Mr President, the developments in the Southern Neighbourhood and the ensuing migration flows are posing a serious challenge for the European Union.
It is also vital that the development aid that is organised for South Sudan is coordinated with and complementary to humanitarian aid.
Bearing in mind that European cooperation is a necessity, not a choice, I voted in favour of the motion for a resolution by the European Parliament on the EU as a global actor.
Parliamentary immunity does not cover ordinary criminal cases. Agnes Hankiss can be tried without her parliamentary activities being called into question. I voted to waive her immunity.
They merely permit the technical and substantive preparation of a political decision.
However, the agreement still needs to be improved as registration by actors is still on a voluntary basis, although a pre-requisite for obtaining access to the institutions.
Professor Lieblova is in Strasbourg accompanied by 28 students from Prague and Hamburg, who have worked together on a two-year project researching the transfer of Czech forced labourers from Hamburg to Theresienstadt concentration camp.
By regulating both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contractual relations, adopting an optional instrument together with a 'toolbox' could ensure enhanced protection of consumers in Europe.
While research - into both fusion and fission - is a good thing albeit diversified, I deeply regret the increase in appropriations EUR 700 000 for 2012 as well as the anticipated financial tinkering, which would lead to part of the European research budget being emptied simply to finance ITER.
Secondly, we need to have an explicit human rights check in the executing state.
This context raises the following important question what future do the common fisheries policy and European Fisheries Fund have If this fund is not being used very much, it means that it needs to be reviewed and reformed.
Moreover, in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, we make provision for a review of the expansion of reverse qualified majority voting.
In this respect, we support these reports on the budget frameworks and the macroeconomic component of the 'economic governance' package.
The text adopted today aims to establish cooperation so as to ensure the integrated protection of the ecosystem and the sustainable development of the Prespa Park Area, including the drawing up of integrated river basin management plans, in accordance with international and EU standards.
The aim of this proposal for a regulation is to simplify and improve the existing regulatory framework for the labelling of textile products, with a view to protecting and encouraging the development and uptake of new fibres.
There is also a need for better dissemination of information and training, in particular, to small businesses and public servants.
The Court of Auditors, which is responsible for external financial control, said that following careful assessment of the budget it had received reasonable assurances as to the reliability of the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 and the legality and regularity of the pertinent transactions. I also applaud the Ombudsman's decision to publish his annual declaration of interests, including on the Ombudsman's own website, and I should like to join the Court of Auditors in praising the quality of the annual activity report submitted by the Ombudsman.
The newly established Euronest assembly should serve as an instrument of exchange and cooperation.
I voted in favour of this report because I believe that an excellent job has been done, despite the complexity of the issue.
This is because of the specific nature of the European budget, with its focus on investment.
The Commission has already made clear in its Smart Regulation Communication that it cannot and will not accept requests that would affect its autonomy in carrying out impact assessments - for instance, the externalisation of the Impact Assessment Board - or that would otherwise affect its right of initiative.
Mr President, in a European Union where we are seeing moves towards renationalisation in all areas, the Treaty of Lisbon should be used as a tool for creating a new community policy the common foreign, security and defence policy.
According to the Treaty of Lisbon, this falls within the competence of the EU. How should we handle this situation
The agreement, which should be supported, anticipates that EU vessels, of which there will be 40 in the geographical area, will take at least 20 of their crew members from Sao Tome and Principe or from other ACP countries African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States, and also provides the opportunity for an observer designated by the fisheries ministry of Sao Tome and Principe to be on board.
While I would have liked a more ambitious outcome, the Garriga Polledo report on the financial perspective from 2014 is a step forward, the result of a broad political compromise within the Special committee, created for the first time in Parliament, before the Commission presents its proposal.
Firstly, there is the view that goes we now have an agreement which is the most extensive in the world.
We therefore welcome both the special report drawn up by the Court of Auditors on professional training activities financed by the European Social Fund, and a study evaluating the viability and options regarding the inclusion of certain elements in the gender perspective.
Its creation is absolutely justified and we want the future regional support system to address regions at the same development level in a fair, simplified and transparent manner. I believe that we must send out a clear message that the European Union looks behind the statistics, especially in the present economic crisis.
a 14-day withdrawal period for the entire EU, to be counted from receipt of the goods, during which consumers buying at distance can change their mind.
We all agree, yes, that we should not eat clones, but we all know that nobody is going to eat clones.
As mentioned by the rapporteur, I would stress the need for the Commission and the Principality of Andorra to engage in further talks in order to take into account and if necessary to adapt bilateral agreements to the ongoing implementation of the Modernised Customs Code, which should be completed within the EU within two years.
Madam President, would not Ms Harms accept that her position and the position of her group is that they are not interested in the stress tests they are not interested in any objective evidence at all.
Madam President, this has been a very interesting and good debate on a very important subject.
There are at least two things I would like to mention which are not in line with that.
In this respect, the future obligation for rapporteurs to make public the names of the lobbies they have met is a further step in the direction of the full independence of the European Parliament, and will ensure that there is a balanced representation of the interests of all European citizens.
Furthermore, the constitution invests the Budget Council, a body that is not elected directly, with the power of veto over the decisions of Parliament concerning the budget, which, in turn, may result in the dissolution of Parliament and a call for new elections, thereby threatening stable governance.
Ms Grale, you want the floor for one minute If you want to speak to make a point of substance, go ahead.
How often is this not synonymous with policies and practices that cancel out or disrespect each country's identity and cultures
Furthermore, the idea of joint and sustainable European policies has lost out on more than one occasion to the interests of the largest countries of the 'old' EU. A perfect example of this is the lack of a rule ensuring geographical balance when filling posts in the European External Action Service.
It would execute numerous tasks, such as checking the investigation systems in place in Member States and coordinating controls and inspections, but no proposal was put forward.
Although experts have been in agreement on this for quite some time, the message has only recently got through to the political sphere, after considerable time and effort.
It is not, as the Eurosceptics claim, an example of European profligacy, but rather a courageous admission that if we do not give ourselves the means to build Europe together, we will remain isolated and powerless.
There is also improved access to information concerning lobbyists, including their names, and we should also applaud the fact that lobbyists who fail to comply with the rules will face various penalties, for example they may be excluded from the register, which will mean they are blacklisted.
In a world of global transfers of assets and capital, and as a logical consequence of the EU's common commercial policy, the investment policy of Member States also has to be coordinated and decided at EU level.
I voted for this report and welcome the fact that bilateral investment treaties are now part of the common commercial policy.
For these reasons, I voted against this report.
The Fund must concentrate its efforts on creating employment, promoting lifelong learning, helping in particular low-skilled workers, those outside the labour market, along with the most vulnerable groups, those who suffer discrimination and, of course, SMEs.
Following the failure of Europe's market share in the growing satellite navigation systems market to live up to expectations, in June last year, the Commission brought forward an action plan on global navigation satellite system GNSS applications.
Even so, it is essential to continue making progress with it.
That involves a demanding degree of coordination of the Member States' positions, but it would result in the increased coherence, visibility and credibility of EU actions at international level.
Of course, that does not mean that public finances and economic performance are not also a matter of collective interest.
In specific terms, this is where we need to work to strengthen the opportunities for young people and, in so doing, invest in our young people.
They will, in fact, be encouraged to act alone.
It is an illusion to think that there were any real alternatives to the economic reform programme.
So I would like to thank everybody for this useful debate once again, it is good that now we have a schedule concerning the future as well, and it is very important for us that, as several Members have indicated, we can combat counterfeiting as efficiently as possible and that the European consumer can trust the traceability of textile products.
This is due to a number of fundamental reasons it is our contention that at a time of ongoing fiscal consolidation across Member States, it is totally unacceptable that the EU's large Cohesion budget should remain untouched by these efforts.
Moreover, the results achieved will convince the whole of Europe that it has successfully enhanced the security of the entire Union.
We know that there is a desire in the European Union to ensure the security of our power stations from day to day. I would also like to add that we know perfectly well that flying over nuclear power stations is prohibited - at least, in France - and that there is no nuclear power station in France which is further than 25 km from an air base, with the air bases being responsible for monitoring the air space above nuclear power stations.
Sporadic cases are reported in 11 other Member States.
Mrs Verheyen, during your speech, the interpreters indicated to me that they could not keep up with you. I did not interrupt you as it seemed to me difficult to do so and I apologise to the interpreters for this. I want to inform the Members that the system is changing so that instead of lighting the warning signal to the President, it will be lit for each of you when you are speaking.
The only important points that the report makes are the acknowledgements that 'the financial sector should meet the needs of the real economy, help to promote sustainable growth and display the greatest possible degree of social responsibility', and that 'during the recent financial crisis, many financial institutions around the world failed at great cost to the taxpayer'. It even claims that some financial institutions and authorities did not understand the nature, amplitude and complexity of the risks they incurred.
Mr President, I thank the Member for his question.
Consequently, the Commission should consider the possibility of establishing a completely new, independent European Credit Rating Foundation ECRF, which would have the right to participate in decisions on sovereign debt ratings and credit rating agencies.
The European Union has prior experience with stress tests, carried out by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors CEBS. The experience dates from May 2009, when the Ecofin Council mandated the CEBS to organise stress tests on the financial system, in cooperation with the European Commission and the European Central Bank.
By 'European family', I mean the overseas countries and territories OCT, which, although not strictly European territories, maintain a special relationship with the European Union, and, in particular, with the Member States of which they are part.
Today's resolution is a step in the right direction, so that after its reform, the common agricultural policy can be fairer and more effective.
As a result, it is the focus of attention of an even larger number of lobbyists, who, moreover, play a key role in the open, pluralist dialogue on which a democratic system is based, and act as an important source of information for Members in the context of the performance of their duties.
However, given the sector's dependence on fossil fuels, and with a view to the new reform, consideration should be given to efforts accompanied by an innovation policy, in addition to the efforts already made to date, so as to make the fishing fleet more energy efficient.
We need to focus on four key points first, ensuring that development cooperation is in keeping with the principles of democracy and absolute transparency; second, guaranteeing respect for human rights; strengthening the role and capacities of civil society organisations and reforming the system of governance that applies to aid, with stronger involvement by the European Parliament.
From 2020, it proposes five-year periods or five-plus-five-year periods which are more in tune with the mandate of the institutions.
A special thanks to this House for producing such an excellent report - the Jaroka report - and the decision, which was an excellent base for our work in the Council.
However, it is becoming ever clearer that we need to stop concentrating strictly on the markets and instead take a more holistic interest in people, which means protecting them, the rights of workers and the right to work.
As such, it is a good opportunity for us to improve the already existing agreement.
Several of you, including Mr Ludvigsson, Mrs Ford, Mr Cancian and Mrs Basescu, just now, called for the tests to be - I shall repeat what I heard - rigorous, credible and transparent.
A characteristic feature of this debate is not only the fact that ever more people are criticising the budget, but also that the results are quite obviously better, for example in respect of cohesion policy, where clear improvements have been made, albeit improvements which have gone unnoticed by the critics of the European budget. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that these positive results must now also be integrated into our considerations regarding future action, or in other words the type of action that must be continued and the regulations that must be introduced, in particular with regard to the recovery of funds.
People have also objected to granting citizenship to people outside of Hungary, but in Ireland, we have had passport facility for people who are officially living in Northern Ireland, which is in the United Kingdom.
The rules on budgetary discipline and on complying with and enforcing it should be strengthened, in particular by giving a more prominent role to the level and evolution of debt and overall sustainability. I therefore agree with an assessment of the sustainability of public finances, including the debt level, debt profile - including maturity - and debt dynamics.
The situation could be improved by simplifying the administrative and financial rules.
That would enable consumers to have access to competitive cross-border offers, benefitting from better choice, better prices and the clear advantages of the internal market, whilst also enabling them to place greater trust in a high level of protection of their rights.
The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 87402EEC of 25 June 1987 on roll-over protection structures mounted in front of the driver's seat on narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors. I supported this initiative by voting 'in favour'.
That is why I would urge you not to allow yourself to be manipulated by members of the Council of Ministers, but rather to set down clear, common, verifiable standards, so that these stress tests fulfil their purpose.
Madam President, a billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon we are talking real money.
This is why we are fighting it is not an ideological battle, it is a matter of the general interest.
The current system, relying on Member States' numerous overlapping, and sometimes conflicting, bilateral investment agreements, should be replaced within a reasonable timeframe by a new framework of European Union investment agreements consistent with the horizontal objectives of EU policies.
It is agreed that early years learning lays the foundation for successful lifelong learning.
The most important thing to stress is that this is 'the one policy area of external action ... which has not been designed to serve EU interests, but to defend the interests of the most marginalised and vulnerable populations of this planet'. As such, Parliament should take on a more important role, not just because of the various ways that this confers democratic legitimacy, but also because of what it can offer in material and procedural terms.
by Georgios Stavrakakis, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the SESAR Joint Undertaking for the financial year 2009 SEC20100963 - C7-02482010 -.
Since I believe there is a need for rapid, quality solutions in line with the recommendations of the European Central Bank, I voted for this proposal for a legislative amendment, which, in addition to encouraging interinstitutional dialogue, strengthens budgetary discipline and obliges each Member State or institution to accept its responsibilities.
It was developed in the 1930s and has come to take on the role of a comprehensive indicator for overall societal development and progress in general. A series of international initiatives highlighted broad support by policy makers and experts from the fields of economics, environmental protection and civil society for the development of indicators to complement GDP, providing more comprehensive information to support policy making. GDP does not, in fact, provide a reliable basis for policy debate.
I would like to characterise the flagship Youth on the Move initiative, part of the Europe 2020 programme, as an excellent objective for the greatest possible improvement of the entry of young people into the labour market, with two main emphases.
It is with great concern that I have followed the corruption scandals in Ukraine and the trials of politicians who are being accused in a way which is sometimes ludicrous.
These are the latest steps in this process of interference and extortion, which is openly colonial in complexion.
This was often very unsatisfactory from the perspective of the citizens.
The rapporteur and her political group also insist on acknowledging that the policies that they have supported and endorsed are the fundamental cause of the crisis, and that the creation of the single currency in the image of the German mark was based on false assumptions, which only served the interests of economic and financial groups in the strongest economies.
The subject is clearly very important, both for its marked impact on health protection and for the fight against the criminal activities associated with the drug market.
One of the features of this instrument is that it gives the European Commission influence over whether the Member States are implementing the 2020 strategy or not, and so it is worth telling the truth. I would urge you to adopt this package, for a lack of agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on this issue will...
With regard to the reform of the wine market, I am in favour of retaining planting rights.
Despite the difficulties encountered in the negotiations, due not least to the highly sensitive international context, the work that has resulted in the proposal for a directive on the management of spent fuel and radioactive waste has succeeded in outlining a coherent, harmonised legislative framework to ensure that this kind of waste is managed safely, no matter what applications and consequences nuclear energy may have in the future. I believe this is where the great strength of the proposal in question lies.
At the same time, the recommendations and views expressed in this interim evaluation are, of course, of paramount importance for the preparation of future activities in the field of research and innovation.
These measures cannot, however, be considered in isolation from the situation of severe economic and social crisis that exists today in the Balkans, particularly in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Kosovo.
However, the decisions by the European Union have not only failed to convince the markets; in some cases, they have exacerbated the situation, such as the famous Deauville decision on the involvement of private individuals in the permanent support mechanism to be created in 2013.
In this context, I have also supported the numerous findings and critical opinions of the European Parliament. I am fundamentally opposed to the continued application of the historical approach to the subsidy system, and I support the introduction of additional objective criteria which take account of the conditions for agricultural funding within the expanded Europe of 27 states.
Particularly the part allowing the introduction of border controls in the EU, even if they are only emergency ones and on a temporary basis.
They were given the best possible treatment and the best possible care at a time when the Republic of Cuba was in a very difficult economic situation.
Less than one third of the EU's population has a higher education degree, compared with over 40 in the United States and over 50 in Japan, so Europe must increase these numbers in order to be able to make itself more competitive in an ever-increasing global economy.
I voted for Mr Hokmark's draft report, which supports freeing up the 800 MHz band for mobile services between now and January 2013 and sets some very ambitious objectives such as freeing up 1 200 MHz for mobile data traffic by 2015.
They only asked for one thing.
The new protocol is in keeping with the aims of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement which seeks to strengthen cooperation between the EU and Seychelles, and to promote a framework for partnership to facilitate the development of a sustainable fisheries policy and responsible exploitation of fishery resources in the Seychelles' fishing zone, in the interests of both parties.
Other elements of interpretation are totally neglected, such as investment in intangible infrastructure, including know-how people, processes and products, to mention just a few examples, and investment in tangible infrastructure, including communication and transport networks ICT networks and road and rail networks, for example. In addition, GDP is not even suitable for identifying regions assisted by EU regional cohesion policy.
The second key requirement is that the commissioners must also accept greater responsibility.
I voted for the report on the new Multiannual Financial Framework because it introduces the option of applying a financial transaction tax at European level.
Road toll charges for the transport sector will therefore reflect the cost of noise and air pollution, as well as infrastructure costs.
The next item is the debate on five motions for resolution on Ukraine the cases of Yulia Tymoshenko and other members of the former government.
It is important to mark those tragic events, which led to many deaths, suffering, division and horrors, but it is even more important to mark and celebrate European unity and peace today.
Finally, I think the central role of the urban issue in cohesion policy is decisive.
However, if we transfer more responsibilities to the EU, expecting it to finance ambitious projects, while, at the same time, cutting funding, then we will be guilty of acting against solidarity within the European Union because we will encourage internal divisions in the fight for funds, for example, in cohesion policy.
Let us emphasise that these should be jobs with good conditions and decent pay.
This appalling agreement was concluded on the sly and ratified one August back in the 1980s.
Russia is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, and shares responsibility for maintaining stability in the world with the EU. The challenges of the Middle East, Libya, Iran, terrorism, energy security, climate change and the financial crisis will be more effectively overcome if our relations with Russia are based on cooperation.
The payments should include as few exemptions as possible, and should apply to the so-called external costs of road transport, including noise and, above all, emissions. I am frankly curious as to how the individual states will justify their unwillingness to introduce payments, at least under Table 1, which is a very watered-down version of what genuine environmentalists want.
Second, as regards promises to the farmers in Europe, gradual convergence is realistic. A flat rate is not feasible at the moment, and I believe it will remain that way in the coming years.
What guarantees is the Commission giving that this problem will be tackled effectively It is giving none whatsoever.
That is the idea expressed in paragraph 9 of the report.
Taking into account established practice in this Parliament, given that the application for parliamentary immunity is misused in this case, and in the light of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree with the rapporteur's position and am voting in favour of waiving the parliamentary immunity of our fellow Member, Mr Gollnisch.
The support package for Portugal, which will also draw on both European and IMF support, is also being prepared.
It would also make sense to perhaps allow national and regional credit rating agencies to operate in the form of a European network.
Why Because, by doing so, they provide useful assistance to local farmers and we do not end up feeding the people yet, at the same time, killing the livelihoods of the local farmers by providing our own food.
In my opinion, the Commission should cooperate more with Member States in drawing up medium-term and long-term outlooks in relation to the qualifications needed on the job market and in supporting partnerships between universities and the business sector, with the aim of making it easier for young people to enter the job market and helping in the creation of innovative companies based on knowledge, the development of applied research and better prospects for graduates on the labour market.
To be honest with you, there are different approaches among the G8 partners to the Hamas-PLO cooperation and to the issue of the 1967 borders.
The Commission will take action to ensure that the Austrian authorities look at the environmental impact of the work that has already been carried out in order to ensure that in any future expansion of the ski area in the region around Damuls-Mellau, the requirements of our directive are applied in accordance with the rules.
Therefore, a proper evaluation of the mainstreaming process, including a list of strengths and weaknesses, must be carried out before further steps are taken.
We refuse to talk about the minors incarcerated and tortured by the United States at Guantanamo despite their being recognised by UNICEF as child soldiers who have been arrested, whereas we would not hesitate to denounce appalling dictatorships and vote for sanctions in other countries.
We need to connect all the alert centres in the European Union, to share statistics, to share information and also to work more together with private companies in order to identify the solutions to this to a certain extent.
Effective human resources management appears to be Eurojust's main problem.
Furthermore, EGNOS is used on a daily basis by 80 000 European farmers and has recently been certified for civil aviation, and should shortly be certified for maritime transport.
We are therefore faced with a truly cross-cutting issue requiring a coordinated approach at EU level that must seek to ensure that antimicrobials can remain an effective tool for combating disease, in both people and animals, must encourage prudent and responsible usage, and must limit any recourse to them to cases where it is strictly necessary.
The transition from educational institution to working life must be as smooth as possible and, in particular, tailored to individual needs, because it must also be possible for young people with inadequate training to gain the skills necessary to be able to work in skilled jobs and to earn a good living.
We are pleased with the nomination of Mr Mario Draghi as the future President of the European Central Bank ECB, as he has shown that he has a professional profile of the level required for this prestigious office, as well as long-standing and recognised experience in the international financial and banking sector.
If people were serious about wanting structural reforms, they could have taken up the suggestion made by David Cameron, for example, of going to the Council and saying funding is to be frozen, but we demand that unused resources should be able to be carried over to the next financial year, so that we can continue to spend them on viable projects and to save money.
Our fellow citizens in towns throughout Greece are shouting to be heard in Brussels, in Strasbourg, everywhere.
After all, when you were the leader of the UK House of Lords, and you pushed through the Lisbon Treaty, which created your GBP 313 000-a-year job, you actually said, over and over again, that this was just a tidying-up exercise and not a significant transfer of sovereignty.
I would like to thank Mr Mikolasik for the clear commitment in his report to achieving results and for the explicit references to the importance and the future development of the strategic reports, the impact of these reports and the way in which they can be used.
At last week's constitutive session of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly, representatives from Belarus were rightly missing.
The codification of Community legal texts is an essential procedure in order to simplify and facilitate the European public's understanding of them, thus contributing to the actual implementation of EU directives.
Expedient control of the EU border with Andorra, a principality in between two large EU countries, France and Spain, will ensure a more profitable and amiable relationship in the future. I voted for this protocol because it will encourage greater information exchanges with Andorra on security-related risk management and controls, as well as the standardisation of EU customs security measures, and will encourage the safe movement of goods between Andorra and other EU countries.
The Commission will then make suitable legislative proposals in the areas which require greater harmonisation.
Croatia asked to join the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction in 2005.
The implementation of Greece's reform plans calls for exceptional efforts from the Greek people.
The EU - thereby revealing its nature and true objectives - mediates this extortion process, whilst creating the institutional conditions for it to be implemented and deepened.
They must also ensure that the project developers provide the international mediating organisations, the IAEA and the Espoo Convention secretariat, with clear and substantiated responses as regards the choice of construction sites, environmental impact, reparations and evacuation plans.
Whereas a commercial agreement is currently under negotiation between the European Union and Canada, the European Parliament, through this resolution that we have just adopted, is expressing concern about the European Commission's approach in relation to public services.
Obviously, the first thing we want to know is what will be done to prevent the errors made in the two previous tests.
One consequence of the proliferation of funds is that they are less visible, and thus citizens and interested parties are less aware of them; another is that this can lead to duplications or inconsistencies and thus reduce the overall impact of this policy.
I am wondering what the outcome of this Council will be. It is supposed to be an opportunity to debate the progress made in the application of asylum and immigration policies, and the consequences of the Arab revolutions, at Europe's borders.
At the same time, it was announced that the Banque Nationale de Paris BNP, for example, would lose much less than the EUR 6 billion in profits expected this year and that, without the exorbitant rates of interest, Greece's deficit would be 1.5 of GDP and not 8. The speculators are stuffing themselves on taxpayers' money and are clearly set to bleed them dry.
This is something good, sensible and important.
Croatia does, however, need to step up the fight against drug trafficking on its territory as this continues to be one of the main routes for drug trafficking into the EU.
Let me explain briefly through the use of origin marking, buyers will be sure they are buying a textile product that is not harmful to their health nor that of their children because the labelling will comply with all the rules of this important regulation which, at the cost of significant sacrifices, European institutions have imposed on all industries in this sector.
From this House, we must insist that those responsible for public procurement within the various administrative bodies incorporate terms into their tender specifications that facilitate positive discrimination in favour of SMEs and remove contractual provisions that hinder their participation.
If we want to prevent these agreements from interfering with the rules laid down by the Treaty, we cannot but adopt the policies and measures contained in the report by Mr Schlyter.
Now they are reviled, and there is no need to go into the reasons why. I am here to ask questions rather than give insights, and I have a number of questions.
Euro bank notes and coins are genuinely a pan-European means of payment, as the euro area currently consists of 16 Member States.
As I have already said, they are difficulties which, to be fair, concern not only the euro area.
The onset of the crisis in 2008 sent EU Member States' deficit and debt levels spiralling to unprecedented levels, thereby increasing the cost of credit and creating serious debt servicing difficulties.
But if we do not take it seriously, neither will the rest of the world.
The problem is that nothing in Mrs Wallis' report proves the objective existence of such barriers, and therefore of a problem that needs to be solved.
I welcome and agree with the rapporteur's observations, and I congratulate the CFCA on the work it does.
Mr President, I wanted to support Mr Albertini. I think we could vote his oral amendment as an addition to the paragraph we voted on because it would be positive if this House were to condemn what is happening in Bahrain, especially the death sentences.
The young woman involved lost four years of her life to her employer, who received a nine-month sentence.
In today's vote, I endorsed the amendments to the Directive on Consumer Rights which make it easier to make purchases on the Internet, because this is a very important step towards the complete lifting of barriers to the flow of goods while at the same time safeguarding the rights of consumers.
The specific existing programmes, like the Cooperation programme, the Ideas programme, the People programme and the Capacity programme, can and should enable the development of knowledge to enable our businesses to innovate more and enhance their competitiveness.
It is well-known that populations in border regions are more likely to suffer for want of infrastructure; it follows that participation of all the parties concerned could lead to the needs of all such populations being satisfied, even in the case of those populations that are further away from the centre of Europe.
We also continue to have concerns about the detention of human rights defenders, journalists, opposition politicians and peaceful student protestors.
Pursuant to Article 2071 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union TFEU, this is the exclusive competence of the European Union, as it relates to matters of foreign direct investment.
Lastly, I entirely agree with Mr Verhofstadt I commend you in all your efforts to stabilise the Middle East and North African countries and, in particular, your condemnation of the killing of Christians in Egypt, but why, as Mr Verhofstadt has pointed out, has President Assad of Syria been left off the EU sanctions list after the brutal killing of innocent civilian protesters by his forces in recent days
The European Commission must translate the current 'Innovation Union' strategic document into an action plan with specific objectives and with measurable and time-framed targets.
The results were not made public, because the market was very sensitive, it was said at the time.
We need to extend it to cover our neighbouring countries. I fully support what Mrs Morkunaite-Mikulenienhas said.
In this light, an initiative for the European Union to coordinate investment policy seems just as normal.
What place does Europe want to give to culture What influence do we want for our works and our creation The digital revolution, linked to globalisation and growing trade, compels us to rethink our cultural and economic model.
I should like to mention the importance of video's exponential growth as an element of communication between different people, and between different institutions and companies.
It must also stress the need to set up a real evaluation mechanism for Schengen that will check compliance with the rules and border controls, identify problems, help solve them and, as a last resort, penalise Member States if they persist in not complying.
If Parliament's security is so poor that someone can walk in here and rob the post office or the bank, and no one even gets caught, there is every reason to make improvements, and fast.
We should welcome this report, which emphasises the importance of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives to combat youth unemployment through efficient and effective measures such as, for example, reducing the school drop-out rate to below 10 and ensuring that at least 40 of young people are educated to university level.
I consider it extremely important for the European Union to play a key role in international organisations. I believe that the decisions made on international policy should not violate the sovereignty of individual Member States. I am also against weakening the role played by each country in the European Union individually in international organisations.
While youth unemployment is currently 21 in the European Union, and close to 25 in my country, this has become a major challenge for Europe at a time when young Europeans deprived of employment are threatened with social exclusion and poverty.
We are also asking you to coordinate management of the EGF, in collaboration with your fellow commissioners, with other policies that have an impact in this area, for example, in the field of competition or industrial policy.
Clear laws relating to the process of whistleblowing are essential in the fight against corruption.
The Seventh Framework Programme FP7 of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities should be evaluated with a view to the current state of the European Union, but with an eye on the future.
Poland cannot afford to increase the target for reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to 30. One solution would be for the Member States to join a CO2 emissions reduction club, on a voluntary basis. I would call for common sense to prevail during tomorrow's vote, against ambitions to reduce CO2 which are economically unfounded.
For this reason, the rapporteur recommends examining the idea of setting up a genuinely independent European credit rating agency, stating that the new European Credit Rating Foundation must be self-sustaining.
In the Netherlands, we would say you are a white tornado.
Every year, the European Parliament adopts a report on the European agencies to accompany the debates on budgetary discharge.
What these legislative documents propose is to perpetuate these intervention measures, which subjugate peoples and countries and transform them into veritable protectorates or colonies.
Lastly, I should also like to express my concern about the message that has been sent out, aimed at instituting a response mechanism that will enable re-establishment of the Union's internal borders in certain extraordinary circumstances.
Finally, Madam President, one more question what is the state of play when it comes to the launch of the European Asylum Support Office in Malta I have heard that there is still a possibility of it getting off the ground.

Lastly, Commissioner, I would like to mention the issue of imports.
These are areas of concern in which we need to make changes in the future in order to prevent and avoid bad management, irregularities, fraud, conflicts of interest and, at the end of the day, bad expenditure.
The nuclear safety regulators in many of the Member States are not technically responsible for this area and referred the Commission to the responsibilities of the secret service, the police, the air force, the army and the domestic authorities.
Antimicrobial resistance AMR is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, and sheep and goat milk and meat production.
It has also addressed solid and far-reaching suggestions for the EU in various areas on the international level, such as engaging with the EU's strategic partners within the UN system, ensuring the important role of the EEAS, enhancing peace, security and justice, and combating climate change. I believe that these are the issues that are critical on the global stage right now, and the EU has to involve itself and play a vital role in all these aspects.
After listening attentively to the Members, we are pleased to say that there is indeed complete agreement on the principles.
In reality, this also means that the cooperation between European police forces must be strengthened, because we must have the ability to see these large-scale cross-border patterns, as this is not a question of small acts of fraud, but of large organised circles of fraudulent activity involving extremely large sums of money, running into millions of euro.
So it will read 'Takes the view that better cooperation among Member States' different education systems - bridging those differences and ensuring mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States - should be emphasised in order to heighten cross-border collaboration and aid mobility'.
In that way, you create a common agenda, and instruments such as joint programming are also of great importance in this regard.
We very much appreciate that.
EU-Mauritania Fisheries Partnership Agreement motions for resolutions tabled see Minutes

This proposal is confined to the codification of the existing texts relating to access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors, without any change in their substance, so I am voting in favour.
The more than 500 million European citizens and their businesses must have the right to effective enforcement of judgments.
I do have reservations about the insufficiently flexible approach taken by the Commission to these concessions, but I am also not particularly satisfied with the Commission's stance - not with your position, directly, Mr Dalli, but at one point, one of your fellow Commissioners, the Belgian Commissioner, Mr De Gucht, went behind the backs of the conciliation committee to appear before this Parliament's Committee on International Trade, where he proceeded to present a whole series of sophisms.
Secondly, on the subject of development aid. I would first like to thank Mr Staes warmly for the fact that we have genuinely achieved a joint report in many, many respects that I can categorically support. I consider it essential that we set development aid priorities in the areas of infrastructure, health, education and particularly agriculture, and in particular I think that perhaps we should consider introducing an evaluation of projects after 10 years.
Therefore, I am naturally very pleased that one of the things we are working on is strengthening what we are calling the European Qualifications Framework, in other words, the scheme that allows young people to use the points that they gain across borders.
Observing the fact that free trade agreements still generally contain few references to social standards, the report mentions a number of avenues, including the social clause and compliance with International Labour Organisation ILO conventions - whether or not they have been ratified already by all Member States.
In the context of the free movement of European citizens within the European Union, I think Bulgaria and Romania joining the Schengen acquis is an excellent step forward and I therefore voted in favour of the relevant provisions being implemented. I also believe that even though both countries have worked hard for the free movement of their citizens within Europe, they should, in any case, continue to bring their controls and rules into line with European standards, given the sensitive nature of the eastern European borders in the Balkans.
The legal instrument that is to be abolished relates to the conditions for accepting the evidence of origin of certain textiles and textile products originating in third countries.
Last Friday, I co-chaired with Secretary-General Rasmussen the meeting of the PSC Committee and the North Atlantic Council in our first ever discussion on Libya.

Mr President, Belarus is not called Europe's last dictatorship for nothing.
In that respect, the conclusion of the strategic partnership agreement between the European Union and Russia is of great importance for our common future.
The effect of such a cap would be to create an administrative and bureaucratic nightmare as landowners sought to divide up large holdings to avoid the ceiling cutting their money it represents the very worst sort of bureaucratic perverse incentive for questionable but probably legal behaviour.

Overarching frequency planning and management at European level is, without doubt, less appropriate for achieving this goal, as the Commission itself also stresses that this can be carried out well and efficiently in the individual Member States. A coordinating role would certainly be desirable, however.
As you said yourself, anything that breaches the European Treaties can also be clarified in a court of law.
The agreement governs many issues, including the presence of observers while fishing is in progress.
They are even less in a position to preach to us, considering that the governments led by friends of theirs have created these deficits through tax reductions that are as unfair as they are ineffective is that not right, Mr Gauzes They make grand statements about the Europe 2020 strategy, but they refuse to allow spending to prepare for the future, such as spending on investment, to be excluded from the calculation of the deficits.
Other institutions could have a little more of this spirit.
We need to develop additional indicators for measuring medium and long-term economic and social progress. I feel that we need to establish clear and measurable indicators that provide information on climate change, biodiversity, resource efficiency and social inclusion, as well as indicators that reflect the household level more accurately income, consumption and wealth.
That is why I believe Mr Verhofstadt is right when he says that we must, of course, be prepared to take up joint initiatives such as the establishment of the European External Action Service, while at the same time making savings at national level.
Unfortunately, we do not have many opportunities to discuss things together and I would be delighted if you would take this opportunity to make it clear to us for once who it is in the Council that is actually fighting against the necessary transparency.
These deportations were chiefly designed to deprive Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania of their social and political elite.
We can note a marked improvement in the situation of SMEs, but progress still needs to be made. SMEs continue to come up against considerable problems in expanding their activities, and sometimes even in surviving.
We are being given by our interpreters the choice to vote 'no' after you have said '' 'Adopted'. I am not aware that the ability to speak Greek is required of MEPs.
The strengthening of Frontex and the move to a common European asylum system are also aspects of such an approach.
In concrete terms, we can see that the EU does not have any transmission lines that could transmit a sufficient quantity of electricity from north to south or east to west.
European fishermen in particular are suffering as a result of this price rise because they cannot simply compensate for the additional costs by increasing their catch or by charging better prices.
Such programmes must also be developed without additional financial expenditure and bureaucracy.
This report disgracefully calls for employers to be able to terminate apprenticeship contracts should the apprentices be deemed unsuited to their employment.
Enhancing the attractiveness and the environment of these discriminated-against territories is to restore confidence among those living there.
Mr Chichester, what I will retain from this intervention is what I assume is your approval of my unorthodox ways.
And finally, a comment I think it was Mr Weber of the Group of the European People's Party Christian Democrats who said that we had to be very careful about the policy we implement concerning migrants, European problems and labour supply. I deeply agree with that.
In this context, the Commission will examine measures to reduce excessive dependence on external ratings, improve transparency, promote competition, introduce the principle of liability and reduce the risk of potential conflicts of interest due to the issuer-pays payment model.

It represented a way for world powers with imperialist ambitions to expand their control of the markets and force new and more intensive ways of exploiting workers, playing work forces from different countries and regions off against each other.
If Pakistan is allowed to join the ranks of those countries that enjoy preferential tariff rates - in other words, if it is to be included in the so-called 'GSP' list - then the matter could be said to have resolved itself.
With a budget of EUR 500 million for 2011, the Commission believes EUR 9 593 391 should be made available for Belgium, so that it can address the redundancies at General Motors Belgium and its four suppliers and producers in the Antwerp region respectively. I believe the EGF should finance active measures towards reintegration into the labour market, enabling new skills to be learnt and these to be adapted to the new work situation that the 2 834 workers will have to face. I also believe that the European institutions should expedite the mobilisation of the EGF for Belgium, as the Member State is guaranteeing the integration into active life of the workers made redundant as a result of globalisation. I would also stress that the EGF should not be a substitute for the legal and financial responsibilities of General Motors Belgium, but rather an additional support granted by the EU in order to reduce the social difficulties that these workers will face.
Antimicrobial resistance AMR is an animal health issue for the European livestock sector, covering dairy, beef, pig and poultry meat, eggs, sheep and goat milk and meat production.

Having said that, what needs to happen before ex-ante controls are improved How can we ensure improvement of the management of implementing organisations What will the Commission do in order to increase further the capacity of beneficiary countries and regional organisations and what is necessary for that to happen In the future, the EU development policy should spend more on funds which offer access to financial services, that is microfinancing funds.

When we talk about the budget, we must also take into account the framework and the general economic context in which we are discussing the budget - this is why, for the moment, it is difficult to talk about actual figures.
That concludes the 'catch the eye' procedure and I apologise to the 11 or 12 Members who were on the list and have been unable to speak, but clearly there is no time for their speeches.
The motion for a resolution shows clearly that there are still serious shortcomings over fulfilment of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon.
That is why it is important that such an agreement should be reached on a democratic basis and that citizen's should remain confident in the controlling role of Parliament.
This is a clever policy.
Now that Abyei has been incorporated into the North, the South Sudanese should be praised for taking a stance of refusing to be provoked.
The creation of 'intermediate regions' as proposed in the report means that relatively rich areas of poorer Member States will still receive support, and will be able to prepare gradually for the point in time when they lose this additional funding entirely.

The Commission, the European Systemic Risk Board ESRB and the European Banking Authority EBA should be clear about what the stress tests are intended to show and they should check and ensure that the assumptions of the stress tests reflect the risks.

Moreover, the report formulates proposals and recommendations for greater transparency and flexibility in the allocation and use of European funds.
When two such mammoths of the commercial trade sector enter into negotiations on a free trade agreement, then this is not simply a bilateral matter.
This is why I am asking the question whom are we discriminating against to be more precise I wonder whether it is the parents, who are exploiting their children, or the children, who are losing, as a result, any opportunity to become integrated because they do not have any education, although, as you know, economic integration through work and resources provides a basis for any other integration.
This is part of a wider strategy to internalise the external costs of transport in all modes to get transport prices right. I would like to thank the Belgian Presidency for unblocking this file in the Council.
Obviously, the home has a crucial role here, but, as the report points out so well, it is also vital to ensure that those working in the ECEC field have a role to play and that there is a process of mediation, something which children and young people particularly need today.
At the same time, I welcome the positive attitude shown by the Croatian authorities to the use of the monitoring mechanism up until the actual time of accession as an additional incentive.

However, Ukraine must implement the necessary far-reaching reforms, in particular, of the judicial system, the electoral system and the constitution, in order to be able to enjoy the opportunities which this agreement can offer with regard to association and economic integration with the EU. In addition, the country must make more decisive efforts to combat corruption.
We will closely follow the discussions on implementation of the labour standards enshrined in the ILO Convention, and I would point out that the Commission welcomes the emphasis in today's motion for a resolution on the need for the EU to promote the ILO core labour standards and the decent work agenda worldwide, including gender equality and non-discrimination policy as a cross-cutting issue.

This can only be achieved if not only the tariff barriers but also the non-tariff and technical barriers to trade are removed.

I note the need to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, to regions with serious and permanent natural or demographic limitations, such as the most northerly regions with very low population density and islands, and to cross-border and mountain regions; this is because the resources and capabilities of these regions can play a significant role in the future competitiveness of the European Union.

Active SFM should be clearly mainstreamed and prioritised in research and practice, and should also take into account public ownership of 40 of EU forests.

Similar restrictions also exist in terms of access to third-country tenders.
The absence of harmonised rules in this area also deprives European producers of advantages relating to production in the EU. I believe the Commission will continue its efforts to find an acceptable solution in this matter.
It undermines the peace settlement of Europe.
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to apologise for the delay.

We need to ask whether it is sensible to recycle all current regional aid through Brussels, or whether the money could be spent more effectively if it was allocated directly to the regions in the Member States.

Mr President, Commissioner, given that it will shortly be one year since the Greek reform programme was agreed, and the fact that the programme for Portugal was announced just yesterday, I think that it is important for us to evaluate where we stand today, what has been done correctly, and where we made mistakes and missed the mark.
To conclude, let me say that we do not yet have a fully-fledged European model for innovation, but what is clear is that it must be rooted in a well-orchestrated, concrete, strong and joint publicprivate effort. I trust that the Innovation Union will take us all the way forward towards such a model.
Let us remember, therefore, that the transport sector around the Union not only represents excessive noise or CO2 emissions but also represents, above all, hundreds of thousands of jobs and an important component of GDP in many Member States.
The potential advantages of a European contract law for the Single Market have been debated a great deal over these last few years.
We need to evaluate to what extent the Basel criteria could cause a serious credit crunch for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Under the terms of Council Regulation EC No 12152009, the preferential tariff quotas apply to baby beef, sugar and sugar products, certain wines, as well as certain fishery products.
On account of a few hundred people, France responded by reintroducing border controls, and that, too, was for domestic political reasons.
We need better, simpler legislation which serves the interests of Europeans.
The report says that compliance with the necessary conditions for application of the acquis in question - data protection, the Schengen Information System SIS, air borders, land borders, sea borders, political cooperation and visas - was evaluated on the ground, and progress in the implementation of measures aiming for the abolition of checks at the internal borders with these Member States was confirmed in situ.
Whilst there is now nothing to prevent us from enlarging the Schengen area, it is worth noting the recommendations that have been made to these two countries. I hope these recommendations will be strictly monitored, especially as regards the borders between Bulgaria, Greece and Turkey, because as you know, mutual trust between the Schengen States relies on countries adhering fully to their reciprocal obligations.
For example, let us create a real Common Foreign and Security Policy to give Europe more influence on the world stage, but also in order to make the best use of public money.
Undoubtedly, this will give Member States additional possibilities to make their national road charging systems more efficient, which means that a better transport-demand-management instrument can be developed.
However, there are still practical obstacles to mobility, especially for obtaining visas and medical papers in different languages, for transferring grants abroad, and for the recognition of qualifications gained in another Member State.
Even though the European Parliament's report on Investing in the future a new Multiannual Financial Framework MFF for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe contains many ideas that should be supported, I did not support it because I believe that it damages the European Union's image in the eyes of its residents.
Now, although this is, and will remain, one of the most transparent institutions in the Union, I still believe that with greater power comes greater responsibility, and this is precisely what we must strive to achieve in the months to come.
The Commissioner mentioned, quite rightly, sustainable development. I would say to you that we have to be very careful.
However, like other technologies, the practical results of the applications are inseparable from the economic and social context in which they occur, and from the ends and objectives they serve.
The message that this Parliament gave was clear that there is a serious problem with fraudulent practices by misleading business directories, that tens of thousands of our small businesses, voluntary organisations, and even charities, are falling victim to these fraudulent practices, and that we need a concerted approach to stop once and for all such deceptive practices.
Furthermore, we have been stressing the importance of promoting investment in public services, of supporting production, of creating jobs with rights, of eradicating poverty, and of combating social inequality.
It is therefore also one of the fundamental policies for combating the long economic and financial crisis that we have been experiencing for some years now.
Mobility eliminates the difficulties which arise as a result of the natural diversity of the individual labour markets, and provides young workers with access to the enormous European labour market, full of new challenges and opportunities to make use of the experience they have gained.
This system needs to be changed, and it was for this reason that I did not support the Muniz De Urquiza report. I believe that it identifies key conditions which the EU and the Member States should meet in order to be able to perform better the tasks enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon.
As you know, the transport sector plays a key role in guaranteeing mobility and socio-economic development in Europe and, in order to address the challenges of economic growth and sustainability, it is necessary to improve transport sector infrastructure.
Following the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union's diplomatic activities have been beefed up with a view to raising Europe's profile on the international stage. I welcome the adoption of this report, which calls for better representation for the Community institutions in international organisations.
I also highly appreciate the outstanding role played by State Secretary Andras Karman, who represented the Hungarian Presidency with such skill and determination.
At the beginning of the year, the European Banking Authority announced that it would be carrying out a separate thematic review of the liquidity risks in the EU banking sector as part of its regular risk assessment cycle in the first quarter of 2011.
My vote in favour is based on the wisdom of this report, which not only embraces the innovations of the Treaty of Lisbon in matters of foreign policy and security, but also calls for greater coordination between the recently created European External Action Service, the Member States and the Commission.
A sort of automatic mechanism was used to show that if energy efficiency was added to the 20 reduction in CO2 emissions then 25 would automatically be possible.
However, I believe that recognition of their usefulness should always depend on respect for certain fundamental principles, such as transparency and independence. I therefore agree with the rapporteur when she underlines the fact that the Commission has recently raised the quality of its impact assessments, while pointing out that further improvements are still needed.
It is necessary to develop other indicators that will help explain which factors influence the living standards in a country.
Cutting the resources from existing programmes will not replace the need for additional new resources if we want to set new objectives for the European Union, if we want European integration to provide real added value, including for taxpayers, who rightly watch every penny allocated to the European budget.
It should not be curtailed by political opponents.
I welcome the results of today's vote, particularly in view of the fact that I was rapporteur for the document on the air transport agreement between the European Union and the United States, which was a document of particular importance.
According to the report, everything should remain as it is more money has been requested for the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, no reforms of the Structural Funds have been proposed, nowhere are there any concrete proposals for more efficiency.
We have an enormous number of free days.
Ladies and gentlemen, the reason why we are meeting with the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy this morning is that we sought to give Europe a voice and a face under the Treaty of Lisbon.
I voted in favour of this report on the future of the common agricultural policy CAP. As a result of the negotiations and the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, this document, though still too vague, has evolved significantly and is now trying to bring about real reform of the CAP.
The Innovation Union flagship initiative is the most significant and targeted Community attempt so far to introduce a strategic, integrated and business-oriented European innovation policy to supplement Member State efforts, whereby innovation is steered and progress monitored at the highest political level.
This is a time to try to understand each other's problems but also respect each other's differences.
If European research policy is to be more competitive and in tune with the EU's economic and social ambitions, FP7 needs to be tailored to four major objectives promoting the simplification of the framework programmes for research and cutting the burdens of administrative procedures; improving the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises SMEs; strengthening the innovation dimension and intensifying the Risk-Sharing Finance Facility.
There is a lot more to do - I do not dispute that - and there is a lot more that you would wish us to do; but do not let us underestimate what we have already managed to achieve and the journey that we are on to do that.
The report nevertheless draws attention to the fact that questions of investment and trade in services need to be raised in trade discussions with Japan in order to ensure that the further opening up of the market does not compromise either European or Japanese rules on the protection of public services, the environment and cultural diversity.
It is really important that we now show small businesses that this was not just a piece of paper.
We should instead phase out the subsidies for the common agricultural policy CAP and the Structural Funds, but unfortunately, the proposal that was voted through goes in the opposite direction.
Three categories of agreement are presented which cover different objectives, namely, horizontal agreements, comprehensive agreements and safety agreements.
These include, in particular, recognising the connection between poverty, a disadvantaged situation, and poor school performance. I would like to remind my fellow Members that there is an additional connection the disadvantaged situation is particularly pronounced in cases where the child is living with disabilities that the parents, who are inadequately informed, neither understand nor accept. I will pay careful attention to this problem in the report I am currently working on. The work carried out by Mrs Honeyball and, in particular, the adoption of a child-centred approach, will be an excellent reference base in the future.
Its management seems crucial to me, and I was very pleased to welcome the creation of the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction REITOX, which enables increased contact between national drug information networks and specialist centres for the sharing of best practices. I view the contribution of a framework for comparison with 2009 and 2008 positively, as it has facilitated the analysis of the increase in its activities.
We therefore need - as she has already said - a coherent EU strategy for culture within EU external policy.
I will conclude by expressing my concern about the incidents and irregularities that have taken place in the administration of the European Economic and Social Committee EESC. As a European-level forum for expressing opinions and reaching a consensus between the three pillars of our productive and economic life, which are so necessary at this time of crisis, it is a body that seems essential to me. That, then, is reason enough to demand that it be administered as impeccably as the other institutions.
Their statements and actions today, with the police of one state refusing to accept the documents of another state, are provoking more than just astonishment.
Innovation Union will also champion the best examples of public sector innovation, and the private and public sectors can learn from each other's best practice.
The resolution also emphasises that the EU is very much in favour of the conclusion of a free trade agreement with Japan, but that in order for this to happen, Japan must abolish non-tariff barriers and remove all obstacles to the development of cooperation.
The report observes that most immigrant children in the EU are educated without adequate linguistic knowledge.
Faced with these many crises and threats, we cannot just hand over the keys to our US friends and allies or to NATO.
The new constitution raises questions on an international level.
In Italy, the search for suitable sites has been suspended.
However, the resulting simplification of the processes will help to promote innovation within the industry.
We need to rebuild the trust in, and value of, this tool and reserve it for only the most serious of crimes, whilst guaranteeing and maintaining the highest of standards in its use.
Mr Garriga Polledo's report sets out to define the European Parliament's political priorities for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period after 2013, both in terms of legislation and the budget.
I want to assure you that the Commission will continue its efforts to help people affected by this conflict.
It is also a ski resort, in the Castanesa valley, and the Spanish state is going to do the same.
If Italy and its border police's security system reportedly lags far behind the ordinary Schengen standard, it is to be feared that newcomers like Romania and Bulgaria could soon also slacken in their efforts.
It is important to implement the proposals advocated in this report, such as better access to credit and financial support, more investment in research and development, clearer legislation, less bureaucracy, a 'one-stop shop', better inter-regional cooperation, and a simple and cheap European patent.
Nevertheless, the negotiations promise to be difficult, since the Commission's guiding principle is to satisfy, by presenting a squeezed budget, the austerity requirements imposed by the Member States, while ignoring citizens' needs.
As Mr Cassini said, the term 'lobbyist' is somewhat unfortunate because it creates the impression of privilege or corruption or both, whereas in reality these are experts in their field who help to inform us of the intricacies and the nuances of the various pieces of legislation that we are proposing.
The contribution of the European Union must also have an added value in multilateral organisations or summits where not all of its members are represented.
I voted in favour of this important resolution on the state of play of the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations.
It is for this reason that I believe what we are witnessing here is a bit of political theatre.
The main task of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction EMCDDA is to collect data on drugs and drug addiction in order to prepare and publish objective, reliable and comparable information at European level.
I support the comprehensive approach to innovation policy and believe that together, we must establish a strategic and integrated European Union innovation policy that is geared to practical adaptation.
We hope that the political authorities will promote the development of a modern, pluralist and democratic state, based on the rule of law and respecting human rights; uphold the primacy of the right of citizens to choose their government through regular free elections, with protection of the freedoms of movement, of association and the freedom to express political opinions.
In connection with this, particular reference has been made to the unforeseen nature of the redundancies and to the impact of the redundancies as regards local, regional and national employment.
I am voting for this motion for a resolution, and would express the same conviction as the rapporteur that awarding the title of European Capital of Culture to a city which was the site of such tragic events in the course of the 20th century would be an important step towards transcending historical European divisions and showcasing the new Europe.
Today, I am delighted with the European Commission's ambition to want to democratise young people's access in Europe.
Frequency allocation comes under national jurisdiction but the regulations governing the sharing of the spectrum between users and operators is under the control of the European Union.
As we all know, it is the nuclear lobby that has succeeded in recent years in promoting nuclear power as a climate-friendly alternative.
Mr Sarkozy and Mr Berlusconi are putting short-term electoral interests first, by fearmongering and making people believe there is an invasion going on. What nonsense When will Europe stop saying one thing and doing another What suggestions are people putting forward today, apart from just words, giving in to populist pressure, reinforcing Frontex yet again and turning Europe into a fortress Borders have never stopped anyone, either during the darker days of our history or today.
One very important point is that the partnership principle must be taken to a new and better level.
The common foreign and security policy is always a major problem in the EU. On the one hand, the large states are traditionally used to relying on their own forces, with France and Great Britain in particular still feeling they are great powers.
I think that we must provide support to Member States and regions by encouraging synergy between structural, social and rural policies.
The American film maker James Cameron spent on his film 'Avatar' the equivalent of the European Union's 'culture' programme for the 2007-2013 period.
Europe cannot remain absent from Camp Ashraf it is a camp where not only international policy is measured but also human rights protection.
I should like to ask the Commission, therefore, if it does not think there is a case for triggering the European emergency clause and bringing forward the discussion on financial compensation.
Is the UK being correctly represented at the Commission
This report relates to the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on rear-mounted roll-over protection structures of narrow-track wheeled agricultural and forestry tractors, in a codified text.
Right now, these are directed at the EU budget, among other things.
Agreement on this requirement for Member States to provide data with harmonised methodology on environmental economy is actually a positive concrete step in the 'beyond GDP' process.
It is also essential to provide Natura 2000 with the financial means for its management and the effective pursuit of its objectives, bearing in mind that many forest areas are covered by it. It is also essential to recognise the diversity of forest ecosystems in Europe and the multifunctionality of many of them, such as, for example, the Mediterranean's montado agro-forestry pastures.
We have put forward proposals to Israel to support that greater access. I want to see the people of Gaza with a future, but I also want to see Gilad Shalit, captive for years in Gaza, given the chance to go home to his mother and father whom I have already met.
The basic principle of our proposal is that every Member State, regardless of how many, if any, nuclear power stations it has and what volume of waste it usually has to process, because every Member State has nuclear waste from medical devices and from industrial research, even if it has no power stations, must take responsibility for its own tasks and also enter into bilateral agreements and develop solutions with other Member States.
There is a natural partnership between the EU and Canada founded on cultural similarities and a long shared history.
Without one single common currency, and in view of the volatility of markets, particularly in the failing eurozone economies, the UK faces the possibility of being tangled in a mire of harmonised credit ratings which would have to encompass all economic circumstances across the Union and could expose UK business and industry to hazardous ventures supported by EU-wide credit ratings.
Mr President, I would also like to protest against the language being used here, against terms of abuse such as 'populists', 'extremists' and the like, for people who simply want to protect the borders of their country.
These two amendments 10 and 11 were supported to stop a cap or ceiling being introduced for direct payments.
Although the directive should not allow discrimination based on the haulier's nationality, Article 7k permits Member States which introduce a system for charging tolls andor users of the infrastructure to offer suitable compensation for these charges, which may distort competition.
One of the fundamental objectives of the European Union is to link human and social development to economic development.
Mr President, I agree with my colleagues who are saying that, when we make such a serious accusation against a country, we have to be sure that we have all the necessary information. I do not think it is about double standards it is about honesty and being professionally informed.
In my opinion, the fundamental preconditions for achieving the overall objectives of cohesion policy are sound financial discipline and, above all, transparency in the allocation of funds.
Leading up to the discussions today are the months of painstaking work by Mr Audy, the shadow rapporteurs, the other members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as well as the members of the Committee on Budgets.
The mass migration of people from North Africa was foreseeable some months ago, and France and Italy should have reacted immediately, together with the Commission.
For some time, the Commission has already been carrying out impact assessments of legislation before submitting legislative proposals to the European Parliament and the Council, but the report states that these impact assessment procedures still need to be greatly improved.
Many of us in this House, with the exception of Mr Farage, are very keen to see the balance - a popular one until now - between the United States and Europe maintained during the process of appointing the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank.
The common security and defence policy is an integral part of the common foreign and security policy CFSP. Both dimensions have been placed within the legally binding institutional framework of EU principles, namely, democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and principles of international law, including the responsibility to protect.
This must be used to achieve more ambitious goals set by the EU. One of them is to build a coherent, integrated and professional EU approach to the external dimension of social policy.
Therefore, we want to guarantee that appropriate funding is made available at the right time and in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, that the national programmes include detailed and reliable cost forecasts and that the employees and the population as a whole are given information about all the issues relating to waste management.
This report, by Mrs Wallis, concerns policy options for progress towards a European contract law for consumers and businesses. A correct option in terms of European contract law could benefit the Internal Market, small and medium-sized enterprises and consumers.
The financing instrument for development cooperation is aimed at helping poorer partner countries in the field of trade and regional integration, the natural environment and the management of natural resources, infrastructure, water and energy, rural development, agriculture and food security, human development and social cohesion.
We would stress the warning that this incorporation of the EDF into the EU general budget must not lead to an overall reduction in development spending with regard to the two current finance instruments.
However, we will also need public participation across national borders.
The rapporteur rightly warns of the sensitivity of the Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece region in terms of illegal immigration. I agree with him when he points to the need for Bulgaria to adopt additional measures, including a special plan that includes measures to be applied at the moment of entry to the Schengen area, and an approach to combating a potential sharp increase in migration pressure common to Greece, Turkey and Bulgaria.
I wholly subscribe to what my colleague, Renate Weber, eloquently said I do think it a bit rich for those of the same political persuasion as the ruling Fidesz party in Hungary to accuse critics of that constitution of being politically inspired.
Consequently, I welcome the call by our Chamber to introduce greater flexibility in the de minimis subsidy scheme.
The aim of cohesion policy is to reduce the disparities between regions and to promote social inclusion, for the sake of balanced and harmonious development. I voted in favour so as to ensure that funds are coordinated better and that regional and local authorities are involved in the development and implementation of partnership contracts.
The rapporteur considers all the conditions for abolishing border checks with Bulgaria and Romania to have been met, but wants the European Parliament to be kept informed about additional measures to be taken on the Bulgaria-Greece-Turkey border, which is one of the most sensitive in terms of illegal immigration.
During the Bosnian war, between 1992 and 1996, Sarajevo suffered the longest siege of a capital city in modern warfare history.
Madam President, I would like to underline what Mrs Bowles has said we are hoping to find a final agreement on the report before our plenary session in July.
The negotiations have led to a few minor positive results - I am thinking of interoperability and mini-hire marketing in mountain areas - but the overall outcome is unsatisfactory. I think a possible conciliation procedure would be the best way to smooth off the sharp edges that still remain unresolved.
The package is made up of six proposals four of them deal with budgetary issues, including a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact SGP, while two new regulations aim at detecting and resolving emerging macroeconomic imbalances within the EU and the euro area.
Having weighed up the issues, I abstained from voting.
As such, I voted for this report, as I believe it is important for the European Union to implement a systematic approach in order to measure social welfare in all its aspects, giving particular emphasis to economic and environmental factors, and to improving quality of life in the medium and long term. I believe that the aforementioned indicators will take on a strategic importance in the definition of future cohesion policy, thereby contributing to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, in line with the principles enshrined in the Europe 2020 strategy.
Then let us tackle the challenge of external representation which will be another major step forward once agreed and implemented.
This paragraph does admittedly refer to the Mediterranean countries, but it should be extended to include all countries involved in the European Neighbourhood Policy.
Madam President, it is untenable to say that the constitution of a Member State is a matter only for itself.
by Mrs Ferreira, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prevention and correction of macroeconomic imbalances-C7-03012010 -
The ETF plays a very important role in helping the acceding countries to enter the EU labour market.
Until now, it has seemed as if European contract law was something unnecessary and the general principle applies that if a provision is not necessary, then it should be omitted. I also believe that this report is a diversionary tactic, designed to draw attention away from the fact that something far more important, namely, EU-wide consumer protection, is still in need of improvement.
One is the issue of the European patent. 23 Member States have already joined the enhanced cooperation and the Council is discussing the basic regulation now.
We need to support reform-minded elements in the North, promote an inclusive political dialogue and enhance our efforts to promote human rights.
This means that EGF has been recognized as a separate specific instrument with its own objectives and deadlines and therefore it deserves an appropriate allocation in order to fulfil all the attributed to it goals and objectives while superseding transfers from unused budget lines, which could be detrimental to the achievement of the various policies objectives. I also support Rapporter's call on the need to address, in the forthcoming revision of the EGF Regulation, the issue of how to treat multinational companies, which restructuring or relocation during major changes in world trade patterns affects, especially in times of financial crisis, common workers who suffer the most from the consequences of it, and hence need the intervention of the EGF.
We have been proposing a list of 27 non-tariff barriers which we think are crucial for our trade relationship, but in only three cases out of the 27 is there now a solution on the table which seems to be acceptable.
Lastly, we maintain that it is important to open negotiations with important trading partners in Asia, including the People's Republic of China and India, since the economic growth of that entire region makes such agreements ever more significant from the point of view of developing world trade.
Europe's rapidly ageing society requires innovative solutions in diverse areas which will make it possible for it to function efficiently in spite of the reduced workforce.
Today, these generics are of vital importance to people across the world suffering from the likes of HIV and AIDS.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the proposal for a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council providing further macro-financial assistance to Georgia.
Let me also be very clear as regards data protection and data exclusivity for pharmaceutical products.
This is the mutual trust upon which the majority of our policies are built in the European Union; without it, Member States are unable to make this political decision that requires unanimity.
Transparency, a uniform quality standard and the presentation of the advantages and disadvantages of a sufficient number of political options are the key to reliable impact assessments.
The European Union must, in my opinion, seize this opportunity to assert its cultural uniqueness and encourage creativity. I am bound to vote in favour of this report, which regards our culture no longer as a heritage of the past but as one of the driving forces of the European diplomacy of tomorrow.
Misleading practices are illegal under the Misleading and Comparative Advertising Directive and the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.
The desired flexibility should be accompanied by close monitoring of the implementation of the funds so that this is done with maximum compliance with the rules of rigour and transparency.
Madam President, Mr Becsey, Commissioner Semeta, President Caldeira, ladies and gentlemen, the regional policy budget remains the Achilles heel of the European Union general budget.
However, we need a strong common agricultural policy and strong agricultural assistance to achieve this goal. I therefore consider it important that pursuant to the report, the agricultural budget be maintained at least at the same level as in 2013 in the next EU financing period.
The report includes the 'new' CAP in the anti-grassroots Europe 2020 strategy, in the aim of ruining small and medium-sized holdings and concentrating land, production, subsidies and trade solely in the hands of the capitalist agricultural companies.
Parliament also welcomes the fact that the Authority has increased its number of thematic papers and policy briefings.
It also criticises any attempt to cut the funding of the DCI and the European Development Fund, and stresses once again that not enough progress has been made with the Millennium Development Goals MDG and that there is a need to increase Official Development Assistance ODA.
The Treaty on European Union provides a framework for, and encourages relations between, the European institutions and European political leaders, on the one hand, and civil society, EU citizens and representative associations, on the other.
You, like Ulysses returning to Ithaca, must not listen to the songs of the sirens, because they want to lure the ship on to the rocks and for the ship of Europe to sink.
The EU has adopted a number of documents on this issue directives 200418EC, 200417EC, 9313EC and 200766EC, resolutions European Parliament Resolution of 18 May 2010, reports Mr Monti, A new strategy for the Single Market - At the service of Europe's economy and society, the European Commission communication 'Towards a Single Market Act For a highly competitive social market economy', and the European Commission Green Paper on the modernisation of EU public procurement policy.
Madam President, I would like to say to the Commissioner that today, the European Union is changing its internal policy regarding nuclear safety but, at the same time, we are beginning work on external energy policy.
The same goes for the foetus, the protection of the foetus, or, for example, for the Hungarian Republic's checks and balances.
We voted against for all these reasons.
He has all the requisites for being an excellent President of the European Central Bank.
We have now reached an emergency situation where solidarity and responsibility are all that count, but solidarity does not just mean all for one.
Unless an eleventh-hour candidacy is received from Kuwait or Nepal, at the instigation of the United States, we could well see Syria heading up the UN Human Rights Council on 20 May.
The first item in the preamble illustrates the vision guiding this report it states that the multilateral trade system established through the World Trade Organisation WTO continues to represent the most suitable framework for regulating and promoting open and fair trade.
We have web streaming and I am sure the interpretation will be there.
Furthermore, it can be misleading in the sense that remedial measures following certain incidents such as accidents and natural disasters are treated as a benefit instead of a cost.
Moreover, I agree with the development priorities and believe that the accounting procedures are perfectly calibrated for the ex-ante prevention of errors, fraud and hoarding by subjects with no entitlement.
Mr President, my fellow Member just said that a year is a good time to look back over and I can bring news from Finland where it will hopefully be announced this evening that the Finnish Parliament will support the financial rescue package for Portugal.
In Mr Schlyter's report, Parliament has now examined transitional arrangements for managing investment agreements that Member States have already concluded with third countries.
However, I would also say here that it is perhaps time to have a general European response by accepting Eurobonds and accepting the possibility of selling them on the primary market, to respond to the international markets.
However, is it not sinister that recipients should be told which economic policies they should choose and which they should discard Surely donors have no right to instruct these new democracies as to which democratic choices they should make
Of course there are many other proposals, on the reinforcement of Frontex and on a common European asylum system, for example, but I hope we will have other occasions to discuss such issues in greater depth.
The correct response ought to be to strengthen the principle of solidarity regarding emigration policy and to get all Member States to commit to applying it. We not only need to offer the opportunity, but also require Bulgaria and Romania to assume their responsibilities and fulfil their duties at the Europe Union's external borders.
Madam President, I wanted to speak about the role that sport can play in increasing economic prosperity in our regions.
This is driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges. I endorsed this important report.
This common transparency register also simplifies matters for lobbyists as this will provide a single means of registration instead of two, which is currently the case.
The substantive difference lies in the fact that this report makes no reference to the origin marking to be included on textile product labels.
We think this is very important because one of the things I consider essential in relation to innovation is that we should have a 'living document' in other words, that we will have the opportunity on a regular basis - in Parliament, internationally at the Innovation Convention, and also at Heads of State or Government level - to monitor progress and to insist, where the progress is slow, on speeding it up. That is very important if this initiative is going to be successful, to create the kind of jobs we want and to deliver what we expect it to deliver at the end of the day.
We also remind the Member States that they must go even further, bringing in legislation to introduce fairer and more efficient tax systems that include all the external costs mentioned, and we urge the Commission to continue to work so that its future proposal on this matter may prove more ambitious.
As I see it, if we are to improve the European Union's representation in multilateral organisations, we must first find a consensus. I am pleased to see that the Union has supported the United Nations' strategy, particularly in the case of humanitarian policy and conflict resolution.
Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for having first spoken about the victims and the people taken ill.
New rights are considered in this new proposal, like the existence of a 14-day withdrawal period for the entire EU, to be counted from receipt of the products.
Savings can and must be made in other areas, in particular, the common agricultural policy, including harmful agricultural export subsidies and tobacco subsidies, in order to fund Europe's economic priorities.
That is a procedural point and you should bring it before the competent committee.
Worse, nearly 25 of young people under 15 have reading difficulties.
I believe that both parties would have much to gain from a free trade agreement FTA that would strengthen their trade relations and remove barriers which have unjustifiably hindered relations. I regret that such an objective still seems far from becoming reality and I hope Europe and Japan will persevere in their efforts to attain it.
It is crucial for the European telecom industry to regain global leadership, but also in order to take the lead in the development of information technologies as such and in the emergence of new services and applications.
Fortunately, last year in this House, the Lkkegaard report on journalism and new media, approved in September, supported the introduction of this subject in paragraph 13. I myself submitted an amendment in this regard.
With this resolution, the European Parliament intends to express its support for the initiative of the International Labour Organisation ILO to adopt a convention supplemented by a recommendation on decent work for domestic workers.
The opinion of Parliament in Brussels is advisory and now, as in the past, the decision lies in the hands of the Council's politicians.
We understand the people who are taking to the streets to protest and, what is more, what we are doing is giving a precise structural answer to those people's concerns good jobs, sustainable growth and room in the future for an adequate social policy.
In particular, the problem of interference and the question of cost offsetting for cultural facilities and local authorities in connection with technical retrofitting, with regard to radio microphones for example, have not yet been satisfactorily resolved.
It is a technical, but necessary, parameter if we are to create a clear trend towards greater productivity, cohesion, competitiveness and access to a single market for European industry as a whole, and that is why I voted for this particular report.
This new framework aims to promote competition and strengthen the integration of EU policies in order to consolidate the Europe 2020 strategy, to the benefit of the usual suspects big companies and financial institutions, and the concentration and centralisation of capital.
Finally, coordination among the national authorities responsible for applying what we call 'backstop' solutions, which are to be imposed on banks that fail this test, has been significantly enhanced and improved.
However, I put it to the House that the cause of individual liberty under the law in the world would be better served if Parliament took more interest in the operations of the European Arrest Warrant.
Madam President, Mr De Gucht, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Schlyter, for his hard work and for trying, in the spirit of the European Parliament, to find a satisfactory compromise for all sides, and looking for the best solution and developing this on a cooperative basis.
In addition to duties, more effective trade cooperation is hindered by the numerous obstructions that Japan has placed in the way of standardisation and access to public procurement and government contracts.
In many cases, the solutions for adapting tractors to the new engines are not yet available or final.
It therefore makes sense for these lobbies and their representatives to be listed in a register, and that their principal sources of funding should also be mentioned in this register, particularly if they come from the European budget.
On the subject of Central Asia, Baroness Ashton, we want to become involved, but we have no representations there. I know that there are financial problems, but we urgently need diplomatic representations in the area.
Although I am pleased to note that we are calling for values which we Europeans consider to be fundamental, I also admit that it was with a certain sadness that I endorsed this report. I am aware that we sometimes call for these fundamental values to be upheld in other parts of the world, but forget that they are also being violated in some of the European Union's Member States.
As the report explains, the EU enjoys a good worldwide reputation in terms of the ideal link between economic dynamism and a social model, which also gives rise to a certain responsibility.
Stage 2 This consists of another review by the national nuclear safety regulators of the reports produced by the operators and an evaluation of the regulators' own inspections and findings.
In particular, to establish true democracy, it needs, first of all, to promote civil society, secondly, end state control, particularly over NGOs, thirdly, have a truly independent judiciary, and fourthly, have a free and strong opposition.
My support for Mrs Schaake's report is dictated precisely by the boost that we need to give to reinforcing this shared awareness.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, quite honestly, we do not understand why the majority of the Committee on International Trade were so adamant in wanting to put this matter forward for debate, only to then ask for it to be referred back to committee, a request that we reject.
Bearing in mind the importance of the trust that European citizens and consumers put in financial institutions and transactions for the stability of our financial system and, consequently, for the smooth functioning of the Internal Market, I welcome the Commission's Green Paper and the opportunity to improve corporate governance structures throughout the EU. Several things will need to be done in order to ensure the smooth and sustainable functioning of the European financial market, the most important of which, in my opinion, are a targeted approach responding to the needs of the real economy and the implementation of a policy of increased social responsibility and risk assessment by boards in order to avoid a financial crisis in the future.
that financial support for the Mauritanian multiannual fisheries programme must be in line with Mauritania's needs for sustainable fisheries development;
Without such a measure, rogue traders and other debtors can evade their responsibilities by simply moving their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying the creditor effective enforcement of the judgment in the Single Market.
We therefore believe that this prize should be abolished.
In my country, Finland, this legislation is now at a fairly advanced stage, and sometimes, obviously, it makes you wonder if we are not going backwards when we make common laws.
Ukraine is not alone in this respect, but it must demonstrate its unconditional determination to introduce more comprehensive and more inclusive reforms if it wants to move closer to the EU. We will continue to provide Ukraine with significant support in its efforts to bring about internal reforms.
The Commission is fully and solely responsible for implementing the decisions adopted by Parliament and Council. A derogation from the decision on the European capitals of culture in relation to a matter as fundamental as its geographical scope would simply break the rules that we have been asked to follow.
The ongoing upheavals, which will increase after the death of Osama Bin Laden, must be tackled in full compliance with the Treaty of Lisbon.
That is something that we will also do in Parliament.
Furthermore, the Greens feared that the measures might pave the way for the inclusion of Pakistan in the GSP scheme without the country having signed and implemented the corresponding labour and environmental conventions let alone the Geneva Conventions. Finally, the Greens wished to exclude ethanol from the list of duty-free products, as it would be made out of sugar cane, which would replace food crops, constitutes a GHG-intensive crop and does not create a significant number of jobs.
We must also bear in mind the challenges facing Europe.
That is simply unsellable to taxpayers around Europe and it does not enhance the credibility of the EU institutions.
As Mr Daul rightly said, that is how to make the life of a Finance Minister easier - by indicating new own resources for the budget and reducing the direct contribution.
As we see it, there is room for improvement in other areas that this Parliament considers important - such as road safety.
It is true that heated debates took place in the Council on the best ways to ensure that peripheral Member States do not feel locked out, and eventually a qualified majority was formed in the Council, and I hope - and I believe that the discussion has shown this as well - in Parliament, too.
The European aircraft industry has long been the chief supplier of civil and military technology in the international market.
We accepted this challenge, however, and set about fulfilling our obligations.
The European Union should therefore continue to use sanctions and incentives in bilateral and regional agreements in order to ensure the implementation of the social provisions of EU agreements.
That is why I agree with the rapporteur on the need to focus on reversibility, in the hope that research will soon result in the definitive transmutation of spent fuel and radioactive waste so that it can be used for other purposes.
Indeed, the EU must enhance its role as a global actor and act as a global decision maker.
In the context of a changing global economic situation and at a time when Europe is slowly attempting to extricate itself from the economic crisis, it is becoming clear that the programme was put in place to solve legitimate and significant problems.
Financial markets and institutions have to take into account, as part of their corporate social responsibility, the interests of all parties involved, including clients, shareholders and employees.
This shared management of borders is an essential safeguard allowing for the full exercise of one of the EU's fundamental freedoms the free movement of persons within the Schengen area.
This is all being done on Facebook, using the system, and it is being bragged about.
It remains to be seen to what extent the new monitoring and supervisory measures will take effect. A whole range of mistakes have been made and there has been a breathtaking lack of ethics, morals and decency, combined with conflicts of interest.
The real problem is how to finance these ambitions in what are today even more dire circumstances - as we see in the European Council and in the discussions about the euro, and as my colleague, Mr Bokros, has mentioned.
This will also set an example to those Member States that have yet to take such a step. I believe that the transparency register will also contribute towards the greater credibility of the political environment.
We need a true European internal market where innovations are better able to succeed through access to a market of 500 million citizens.
The path taken by Russia towards an essentially liberal, pluralist democracy has experienced both advances and setbacks, but it is undeniable that the country has come a long way since the days of the Iron Curtain.
This was the Fundacion Alternativas, which provided a good foundation for me, as well as the shadow rapporteurs and the secretariat, in our work to produce this report. I hope the report will prove useful in politically determining and stimulating the redefinition of the European Union's role in international organisations.
Although the role of the Commission is strengthened, the report should clearly support the reversed qualified majority voting as planned in the first place to ensure independent and fast procedure of applying needed measures. I welcome in overall the call for greater transparency and involvement of European Parliament and national parliaments.
After the great imperialist powers have finished carving up the African continent in their own interests, everything points to the belief that a process has been restarted in South Sudan which will lead to more wars and suffering for the already severely devastated populations of Africa.
Commission representatives on the governing boards of agencies make every effort to ensure that the recommendations stemming from external evaluations, and those from the Court of Auditors and the Commission's internal audit service, are followed up appropriately.
Of particular concern is the situation regarding democratic development and human rights in Russia.
We have a responsibility to finance countercyclical policies, not least through a strong cohesion policy, Mr Pieper, which promotes public investment and employment in all European regions. I would like to stress the importance of creating an intermediate regions category to ensure that the allocation of Structural Funds accurately reflects economic and social realities in the regions.
It is something of a challenge to bundle all these reports together and give evaluations of them, but perhaps I can express a few views on them.
However, if the European Union fails as a transnational project for securing peace and prosperity and breaks apart, then it will be more than just a political union that breaks apart.
The Agency must take measures to implement the recommendations.
If we ignore the Romantic, almost monarchist ideas which pervade the spirit of the preamble, I would like to mention some areas we regard as being highly sensitive, in contrast to our fellow Members from Fidesz who are also Members of the European Parliament.
However, this is about segregation based on ethnic criteria, reducing the influence and undermining the authority of a state within its borders in favour of another neighbouring state, about breaking up territories belonging to one European Union Member State and annexing them to another Member State of the same European Union.
Parliament is of the opinion that, in view of the size of its budget and the complexity of its tasks, the Joint Undertaking should establish an audit committee, reporting directly to the Governing Board.
Basically, what this involves is that a misleading business directory sends out a form, which appears to simply request people to update their own personal details or their business details, in return for what appears to be a free entry, a free listing in the business directory.
We cannot have this total secrecy and I very much hope that, irrespective of what we think about this link between policy and investment, when it comes to transparency, we can stand united and defend openness and the new competences bestowed on us by the Treaty. I truly hope that that will be the case. I therefore hope that Amendment 13 will receive support.
We cannot produce a communication like this in two days.
Everyone seems to agree on this point.
Bulgaria and Romania have been subjected to the evaluation of the proper application of all parts of the Schengen acquis control of the land, sea and air borders, police cooperation, visas, connection to the Schengen Information System SIS, and data protection.
We are of the opinion that the intermediate category will help regions which need more support than the classic Objective 2 regions.
Small and medium-sized enterprises make a major contribution to the European economy as the vast majority of companies belong to this category and they provide jobs for over 90 million people throughout Europe.
However, it also brought about massive de-industrialisation and a squandering of state assets.
Let me say that many of the Member States already comply with large parts of this directive, but implementing this minimum series of requirements will introduce discipline and restore confidence, and is a first small step back on the path to stability in public finances.
Since farmers' primary goal is to keep their livestock healthy and productive through good agricultural practices hygiene, proper feed, appropriate husbandry, responsible animal health management, I think that more research needs to be carried out on the new antimicrobials, as well as on other alternatives vaccination, biosecurity, breeding for resistance and on evidence-based strategies for avoiding and controlling infectious diseases in animals, which are deployed in the European Union's research framework programmes.
Since the fiasco with the euro rescue package, the net contributors have been asked to pay up two and three times over.
The directive sets out a series of requirements in accounting statistics, forecasting and budgetary processes.
This Eurovignette is only a tiny step forward towards that goal.
During the previous parliamentary term, the Conference of Presidents created a Working Party on Parliamentary Reform, tasked with reviewing the functioning of Parliament and suggesting improvements.
Then there is the obviously low treatment cost in third countries, which is the main economic factor encouraging or driving these illegal shipments.
From the outset of this textile report, I have been of the opinion that Parliament should keep to the scope of the proposal as it was originally designated and that the extension of this scope was not compatible with the aim of simplification for putting a new fibre on the market.
Why Simply because it was constructed as a political and not as an economic project, and therefore the criteria were ignored; figures were changed to bring in countries that were not yet ready.
Conversely, the European Union wishes to create proximity where history had created distance, misunderstanding and sometimes hatred.
Commissioner Rehn reported this evening that it has succeeded in reducing the cost of doing business by 22 in some areas and will continue to concentrate on this initiative.
The main obstacle making it significantly more difficult for European businesses to gain access to the Japanese market is non-tariff barriers.
Multilateral action is the only way that States can get to grips with the challenges facing our world.
In reality, the common market requires rules that are more precise and transparent, such as the clause on the requirement for information on the mechanisms of online transactions.
One of them is my friend, Anatol Lyabedzka, a wonderful Belarusian and European, who only recently was released from prison after spending over 100 days under arrest, something which I am profoundly convinced was unlawful.
We take note of this request and will pass it on to the relevant bodies.
In addition to this, the Commission is working closely with Member States and the EU Presidencies for the development of indicators for the follow-up at EU level of the 12 areas of concern of the so-called Beijing Platform for Action.
They run counter to the strategy which has been pursued up until now, aimed at building international alliances based, for the most part, on the assumption that the North Atlantic Alliance will play a leading role.
Impact studies should be applied to all legislative proposals, they should have a clear methodology, and they should be undertaken with full independence and transparency. IAs should also assess the option of inaction, as well as the specific consequences for small and medium-sized enterprises.
Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious obstacle to sustainable development in so far as it may affect 'living aquatic resources'. The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing has been concluded, under the aegis of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation FAO, and it requires European Parliament approval to be permanently binding for the Union, so I voted in favour of concluding this agreement, as it is a central point of the common fisheries policy.
Our European institutions have suffered a major collective failure.
This perspective - which some people also call the social market economy - is actually a new paradigm that goes beyond welfare economics and returns instead to the centrality of the human being.
That said, I believe that the issues addressed by Mr Audy and Mrs Carvalho - on which I will focus in other speeches - are all worthy of note.
We protest against the elimination of political opponents in Ukraine with the help of the judicial system.
As was mentioned this morning, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, whom I very much admire, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, explained to us that this is not a closed story, that it is still going on, and that he would very much wish for Parliament to cooperate with the Council of Europe on this important issue.
Nevertheless, the stumbling block is the implementation of these instruments and their enforcement in partner countries.
This package is important. I would like to say a big thank you to my fellow Members.
Has the fact actually ever been discussed - and this is another issue - that always right on time just prior to an Ecofin meeting, just before a European Council, one, two or three credit rating agencies assess whatever is on the table as a solution to the problems as being inappropriate Who in actual fact are the people who are wielding the real power over economic development in Europe Who is behind them
We also deplore the fact that the right-wing in Parliament rejected the amendment designed to ensure equal treatment of European and Indian workers.
Romania manages one of the European Union's longest external borders, as a result of which it has developed the most advanced, integrated security system, complying with the standards set by the Schengen acquis.
The Commission should also negotiate effective and transparent procurement systems and India should apply transparent and fair procedures when awarding public contracts and grant European businesses access to public procurement systems.
There are increasingly large economic divergences and social inequalities caused by the EU's neoliberal guidelines and policies, and by the increasingly unfair sharing and distribution of national income, both at EU level and at national level.
Madam President, I am very grateful for the valuable debate we have had here this evening and I would like to thank all the Members who participated in that valuable debate.
I met an elderly lady whose husband was a taxi driver.
Commercial relations between the European Union and Canada can go well beyond the commitments undertaken through the World Trade Organisation as long as they are based on a balanced agreement, a guarantee of proper reciprocal access to each other's markets and improved protection for trademarks, patents and geographical indications.
Mr President, a regulation on the European environmental economic accounts sounds very boring but, in my experience, that makes it the most dangerous kind of EU legislation, because you think that the taxpayer and the media will not bother to read it.
Both the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control have delivered a positive opinion on the implementation of the budget of the Community Fisheries Control Agency.
The information supplied by the Centre provides a basis for analysing the demand for drugs entering the EU and all the phenomena associated with the drug market, so as to be able to work out how best to combat these problems.
I endorsed this report because the international system is undergoing rapid and profound change, driven by the shift of power towards emerging international actors and deepening interdependence, encompassing economic and financial problems, environmental deterioration and climate change, energy and resource scarcity, and interconnected security challenges.
Colourants, gases to increase shelf life, growth hormones, antibiotics, GMOs and much more besides are used - preferably without consumers being able to read about it on the packaging.
Money for this project has to be taken from other headings in the current multiannual budget, and that means that what we are dealing with here is a revision of that budget.
The public authorities should deal with the further distribution of the information themselves.
The Commission should produce a comprehensive analysis aimed at securing a more precise description of possible scenarios and resources in terms of operation and use after 2013.
Qatar was awarded it and subsequently we saw people suspended for trying to sell their votes. I wonder whether this is the tip of the iceberg.
However, we chose to reject the report which was approved by 345 to 246 votes.
Mr President, in the five months since 19 December, the political atmosphere in Belarus has become dramatically worse.
Vocational education and training should create the conditions conducive to labour mobility, both during initial studies and as part of the lifelong learning process.
As a result of the global economic crisis and the instability that continues to plague the euro area, the Commission proposed a number of legislative initiatives, cumulatively known as the Economic Governance Package.
Journalists such as Joanna Lichocka, Tomasz Sakiewicz, Rafa Ziemkiewicz, Jan Pospieszalski, Grzegorz Gorny, Tomasz Terlikowski, Bronisaw Wildstein and Wojciech Cejrowski have lost their programmes - and these are just some examples among many others.
We are in favour of creating national budgetary frameworks that guarantee transparency, economic coordination and verification of compliance with European commitments.
As the primary role of the IMF is to work on conditional structural reform packages to accompany the distribution of funds to members when they are in dire straits, I believe that Ms Lagarde has shown that she is well able to broker complex agreements on controversial issues, successfully bringing together disparate parties to reach a beneficial solution.
It is therefore necessary to establish strategic cooperation, sharing not only economic and commercial interests, but also the goal of close cooperation in Europe and internationally. I hope that this cooperation develops in accordance with the principles of respect, trust and solidarity.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
We need to ensure that our young people have opportunities to learn and to move abroad to continue their learning if they wish, as investing in education today will better equip the EU to face challenges in the future.
However, as Mr Klinz rightly points out, this business model risks drawing attention away from protecting investors and towards protecting debt issuers, unless suitable corrective measures are taken. I do not think that competition can be improved, since the proliferation of agencies could undermine the credibility of ratings.
The Schengen Area is rolled back on a daily basis and national barriers re-emerge as the European spirit and legislation are ignored or broken by fellow Member States. A non-existent common foreign and security policy assisted by a huge External Action Service would seriously undermine European credibility in the world.
If we are to preserve our forests as we know and love them, we must be at the forefront of the fight to ensure sustainable management of forest areas and to protect them from the threats that hang over them.
Based on the opinion of the Consultative Working Party of the legal services of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, this proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the permissible sound level and the exhaust system of motor vehicles concludes that the proposal in question is restricted to the straightforward codification of the existing texts without any change in their substance.
The third section is devoted to the impact assessments carried out by the European Parliament, which its committees are invited to use more extensively in order to further improve law making.
It is inseparable from preventing forest fires, disasters which decimate extensive areas of forest annually in southern Europe, particularly in Portugal.
I voted to give the European Training Foundation discharge for its 2009 budget and welcome the Foundation's initiative of providing the discharge authority with the IAS Annual Internal Audit Report concerning the Foundation.
Only Italy has asked us for a reallocation and we approved it. So why do you not try to persuade the Member States - the governments of your countries - to use the funds properly If we really want to help, and if there is a problem with absorption of the funding, I am here to facilitate it for everybody, but until now, no such effort has been made.
In order to ensure sustainable development and appropriate environmental policies at EU level, it is essential that policy makers are provided with reliable data on the environmental impact of economic activities. I support this resolution as it lays out a number of effective measures for the collection of more comprehensive data.
I support the draft Council decision on the conclusion of the Agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Croatia on the participation of the Republic of Croatia in the work of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction because the number of deaths, compared with last year, is falling for all drugs except heroin, and progress is being achieved as a whole in the fight against drug use.
The legal base is also questionable, as the European Parliament's legal opinion, dated 1 April 2009, shows 'It seems virtually impossible to justify the ban on the sole basis of animal well-being, since the Treaty contains no legal basis on animal well-being'. The protection of the species, for its part, is not at stake, its population having even tripled in Greenland over 25 years.
They are risking their lives, clamouring to improve conditions and to start the transition to democracy by toppling the current regimes.
Agencies were also advising companies on ways to present their higher-risk products as low risk, and this misleading practice meant that these products turned out to be more toxic than their rating would suggest and led to huge losses for investors, including pension holders across Wales.
In future, I would like Member States to be able to define thematic sub-programmes packages of measures which specifically target young farmers and recognise that they are a priority group in the Member State. I am thinking of measures for setting up, vocational training, training services, investing in modernisation and restructuring farms.
The next most important aspect is the time it takes for it to be transmitted, the strength with which it is transmitted in order also to enable coexistence here, and, finally, the priorities that are established by means of the software.
An agenda must be established for sharing research, knowledge and best practices. I support the request that further research be done on animal welfare and agricultural practices, such as improving herd management, early prevention of disease and the breeding of robust varieties of animals.
These groups, and I quote verbatim from the Europol report 'are seeking to expand their interests in the EU, and may exploit opportunities in the possible accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Zone'. Europol Director, Rob Wainwright, stated in an interview that 'The possible accession into Schengen of Bulgaria and Romania and visa liberalisation for Ukraine - one would see these as potential new opportunities for organised crime'. We have a duty to our citizens to take Europol's warnings seriously.
Despite the commendable efforts of the Swedish and Belgian presidencies, the Member States have not managed to reach agreement to this day. I can assure the honourable Members that the Hungarian Presidency is striving to find the way to progress with regard to the particularly problematic issues of this proposal and will continue to do all it can to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.
The removal of these barriers would encourage more SMEs to exploit the potential of e-commerce. I believe SMEs are crucial for economic recovery in many Member States.
This report relates to the proposal for a directive of Parliament and of the Council on indications or marks identifying the lot to which a foodstuff belongs, in a codified text.
Secondly, would you not accept that the circumstances faced by Fukushima were quite extraordinary and unprecedented, both in terms of the strength of the earthquake - the strongest ever experienced in Japan - and the height of the tsunami, which reached a maximum, I am told, of 46 metres, and had an average height of 14 metres, conditions that we might not expect in Europe
The Council, like Parliament, is responsible for Europeans. I hope that the Council, with the Commission and Parliament, will share their responsibility and take the necessary steps on this economic governance package and future actions.
Any threats that could cost the nuclear industry too dearly, such as human error or plane crashes, are simply ignored, despite the fact that these are key when assessing the safety of the population.
Mr President, Mr Dess, honourable Members, this report has come at a pivotal time, just as the Commission is drafting detailed legislative proposals that it plans to present to Parliament and the Council in October.
That is why we have tabled this oral question and this motion for a resolution before the House, given that this aid does not cost the EU budget anything and that, furthermore, the increase in aid being requested falls far short of the de minimis aid received by other sectors, such as transport or agriculture.
But look too at all the letters from industry, really lobbying for going to 30 because it is in their interest; it helps their profits if we step up our climate ambitions.
The international consequences that we, as an international community, must suffer are by no means limited to the territory of the former Soviet Union, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, because more than half of the fallout following the fire and explosion fell on the territory of the European continent.
However, if nothing else, we could say that something positive has come out of it in that they will have the opportunity to think again and realise that there really is a need now for outside help.
Another nuanced issue while I understand the addition of the need to ensure sufficient spectrum for audiovisual services, that should not single out specific modes of delivery.
There is still substantial work to be done, but I hope that at the end of the month we can sign off on the remaining chapters in the Accession Conference.
I am pleased that you fundamentally agree with the concept of the European legal framework and that you support our proposals on the responsibility for the national programmes, on clear working, timing and financial requirements, on information and on the full involvement of the general public at an early stage in every national implementation process.
When we bear in mind the importance of Japan as a trading partner - with bilateral trade with the EU standing at EUR 120 billion a year, and with the EU being the number three trading partner for Japan and the number two investor in Japan - I think we recognise that any bilateral agreement runs the risk of undermining multilateral agreements with the rest of the world and, in particular, with the developing countries.
At the time, the EU decided to extend existing national accounts, and the statistical data to be compiled, to key aspects of sustainable development.
The meeting of the EU-Ukraine Cooperation Council which is taking place in the course of the next few weeks will give us the opportunity to discuss numerous issues that are important for our relationship and to send clear signals to Ukraine which are the same as those that you are sending about the importance of reform in this area.
It also provides for the requirement of prior declaration of goods to be abolished, on condition that the EU and Andorra guarantee an equivalent level of security as provided for in the relevant acquis in their respective territories.
So we shall no longer call them lobbyists but stakeholders.
What she is saying that Mr Barroso stated was not hypocrisy.
Moreover, it is undeniable, beyond the CEPOL case, that a number of EU agencies with common fields of intervention are performing similar or complementary activities from headquarters located all over Europe.
I voted in favour because I advocate freedom of expression for Members when performing their duties, and in order to defend the interests of the European Parliament as an institution.
It is about taking the very basic blue-sky research that we do so well in the European Union, and translating it all the way to the marketplace so that we provide the jobs here, and they are not provided abroad.
Commissioner, I ask that you make sure that the EU representatives at the summit in Nizhny Novgorod will give recognition and support to the civil society organisations.
Given the economic crises the EU is facing, it is essential we identify which areas of our activities lend themselves to helping us overcome our difficulties.
Unfortunately, in these cases it seems too early to talk about any stress tests.
We must ensure we take the necessary steps to ensure this industry achieves its full potential.
It is to be hoped that this report can reinforce the firm nucleus of the work parameters incorporated in International Labour Organisation ILO legislation.
Yesterday, we voted in favour of the principle of independence in the impact assessment system.
What is more, the effectiveness of the measure has not been proven road transport and its associated pollution costs will continue to increase until an intermodal infrastructure network has been developed.
Personally I think EU development policy might be superior to the trade and investment policy of the Union.
Taking into account the results of the evaluations and the visits carried out by teams of experts, I am completely in favour of full accession to the Schengen area for these two Member States, even though certain problems are still to be resolved and will require follow-up. I would add, however, that it would be unfortunate if new conditions, which were unknown at the time of the request and evaluation, were imposed along the way.
First, we need to be aware that cities are an important platform for implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy, for reasons that include their undeniable importance in the economic development of Europe's regions.
In this context, it is appropriate for the Commission to monitor market developments relating to this directive and its implementation, particularly with regard to possible barriers to the internal market and further harmonisation needed to overcome these obstacles.
To that end, the EU must make the necessary resources available to both countries to support social services such as education, health, agriculture, food security and institutional capacity building, and it should maintain this humanitarian aid for both countries after 9 July, the date on which South Sudan will officially gain its independence.
That seems utopian to me in view of the ongoing events in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean countries. I voted against the report because it seeks to limit national powers while creating new agencies and tackling new military operations, which would entail increased spending, and it also wants to give added momentum to Turkey's accession negotiations.
The fourth and final section calls for an autonomous IA structure within the European Parliament which all of Parliament's committees should use to further improve law making and create synergies.
However, Europe's framework programme has a reputation for being the most bureaucratic in the world.
I voted in favour of this resolution on the Commission Green Paper on forest protection and information in the EU preparing forests for climate change.
I have the pleasure of informing you that members of a delegation from the National Assembly of Mauritania have taken their seats in the official gallery. I would like to extend a warm welcome to this delegation led by Mr El Arbi Ould Sidi Ali.
Pre-term birth is the number one cause of infant death and premature babies are far more likely to develop lifelong chronic illnesses.
Madam President, in December last year, I visited Japan and one of the concerns that was raised repeatedly by the Japanese officials was the slow progress in trade relations between the European Union and Japan.
Governance for innovation must mean establishing new partnerships enabling efficient innovation systems that mobilise intellectual and entrepreneurial capacities, detecting also sleeping innovators - of which we have many in Europe - through a business environment that is conducive to innovation, and particularly for SMEs, covering all sectors of the economy.
We cannot forget that youth unemployment figures are overwhelming throughout Europe.
These practices must be condemned, because they do not enter into the spirit of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact and, above all, because they greatly harm the economic recovery of economically powerful nations such as Catalonia.
My oral amendment, and my Group, aims to speak for and protect fairly and equally all overseas territories and countries, and not to speak specifically about Saint Pierre and Miquelon.
Limiting direct payments to active farmers is another point on which your expectations and my vision of the future common agricultural policy coincide.
However, there are still a few things that need to be taken into consideration and discussed.
Beyond that, we are now seeing an apparently never-ending power struggle being played out.
It does not depend on how fast or how slowly a President announces in whatever language the numbers; the interpreters have the list in front of them.
I voted for this report and take the view that, in order to be consistent with the EU's own values, EU foreign policy and external action must give priority to promoting democracy and the rule of law, good governance and fair societies, given that a rule-based democratic society is the basis for upholding human rights as well as for enhancing stability.
Firstly, uneven geographical participation and poor participation in projects by researchers from certain parts of the Union, especially those from the less developed regions and from the countries which joined the EU in 2004 or later.
I would therefore like to ask the EU, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council to try harder to support Member States, and to push harder for them to invest in this area, because it is only through the money we invest in research, innovation and education that we can really fulfil the objectives of Europe 2020.
In short, the European budget should be used where it makes a difference, as it has the nature of an investment and has no deficit.
My personal view, as one who worked in a small business for 25 years, is that actually, while it would be nice to reduce this burden of administration, the best we can do for small businesses is to improve access to information and to finance.
Let me remind you that Russia is the only external partner with whom the European Union holds two annual summits.
We would like the protection of biodiversity to be a priority for the European Union through its various fields of competence.
That opens great opportunities for the individual, who can move where there are jobs, and also for the economy.
This would avoid many of the difficulties encountered with other trade agreements because we were not consulted. I would welcome such a procedure for all future trade agreements.
It would therefore be good, when we vote on the amendments tomorrow, if we do not carry out a final vote, but rather refer the matter back to committee so that we can see what comes out of the WTO talks and whether it does actually make sense for us ultimately to give our consent to this package.
This grants the Executive Director of the European Food Safety Authority discharge in respect of the implementation of the Authority's budget for the financial year 2009.
There was an immediate response to assist the countries in North Africa - more than EUR 1 million for humanitarian assistance - and this assistance will continue.
It is generally agreed that the SGP has failed in terms of both prevention and correction, and needs to be reformed.
This will hopefully be the case, but we should not start applauding yet.
The enforceability of the right of free movement conferred by EU law is particularly relevant in cases of discrimination on the basis of nationality, as the individuals concerned need to have suitable mechanisms to ensure such rights are properly protected.
These are all things which damage the reputation of the European Union every day, because everyone who looks at the situation puts their head in their hands and says 'You cannot seriously mean this'. Most importantly, some agencies have not reached the critical mass to enable them to work efficiently.
Until now, we have managed to achieve recognition through research and innovation, which guaranteed the production of innovative textile fibres.
My appeal to the Greek leaders is to explain in honest terms to the population of Greece the difficult choices that the country has to make.
That is what I see as the biggest threat, in other words, that conflicts concerning various side issues take the focus away from the main issue.
In my opinion, it is right for both sides to prioritise efforts to reach agreement over several fundamental points, such as the issues of public procurement, investment and public services.
Unfortunately, the list of social problems in Lithuanian urban areas is somewhat longer.
The Europe 2020 strategy lists the key factors for smart growth fostering knowledge, innovation and education, and promoting the digital society, sustainable growth more resource-efficient production going hand in hand with enhanced competitiveness, and inclusive growth increasing the employment rate, training, and eradicating poverty. What is needed, as far as vocational education and training are concerned, is to take practical steps at EU level and in the Member States to breathe life into the strategy.
The Court of Auditors has been able to obtain reasonable assurances that the annual accounts of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for the financial year 2009 are in all material respects reliable and that the underlying transactions, taken as a whole, are legal and regular.
There are Member States, and here I am looking at Mr Busuttil, among others, since he brought up the issue so forcefully, who seek the support of the European Union when they experience problems; it is an expression of European solidarity that we should provide help when, for example, Malta experiences a problem with refugees.
Thought should be given to whether the EU should take on greater responsibility and play a more effective role in achieving joint objectives engaging in joint dialogue, deciding on and coordinating joint measures, etc. under the agreement between the EU and the OSCE.
Secondly, I explained during the debate and I will explain once again that I have learned a lesson from this. I now realise that we need to do more to introduce tougher safety standards for European nuclear power stations.
In addition, care must be taken to ensure that any court judgments are enforced quickly, so that the individuals or companies responsible and liable for compensation have no margin to evade their responsibility by simply transferring their assets to another jurisdiction, thereby denying effective enforcement of the judgment on the debtor within the Single Market.
There was talk of restrictive solutions in respect of limiting the deficit.
With due regard for the opinions of the legal services of Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which have concluded that the Commission proposal was confined to straightforward codification of the existing texts, without any change in their substance, I welcome the adoption of this proposal at the first reading.
On the trade and economic side, the level of ambition should include, at least, aiming for the following 100 duty and quota-free treatment for all goods; a robust and credible road map for eliminating a critical mass of non-tariff measures; an open investment regime to achieve levels of foreign direct investment into Japan comparable to those of other OECD countries; and a government procurement market with a level of openness matching those of the EU countries at all levels of government.
The European Union's foreign policy appears to be poorly thought-out and poorly coordinated.
By doing so, we will have taken the first crucial decision. I am very confident that we will succeed in strengthening the credibility of Europe and of matters relating to the environment and to the economy as a result of these environmental economic accounts.
Secondly, one has to ask what power, what competence, do we have to bring the issue of a national constitution to the European Parliament in the first place Member States have a sovereign competence for establishing their own national constitutions, and in this case, we should respect the right of the Hungarian people to determine their own constitution adopted by their democratically-elected national parliament.
What is advancing faster than anticipated last year is the creation of the European Emergency Response Centre. I can assure you it would make a big difference because it would allow us to accelerate work on scenario planning - what kinds of disasters we have to be prepared for, and also on modelisation of the committed Member States' assets.
It is only after this that we review the Schengen system and look at how it can be adjusted or improved, because we can see that there are indeed problems with it, but let us stick to this order of things.
First of all, I would like express my sincerest gratitude to Baroness Ashton for the EU's full support to Estonia in trying to resolve the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
This approach does not prevent the banks from reflecting certain specific aspects of their trading book or a particular management model.
Directive 86415EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74150EEC, as replaced by Directive 200337EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74150EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning the installation, location, operation and identification of controls.
Not only through its direct consequences, but also by the moral stand that we show our citizens.
We are also trying to improve the work of the European Defence Agency and to take up some of the challenges that we have clearly seen in the responses that we have had in recent weeks, especially in Libya.
I am sure that with Parliament's strengthened role under the Treaty of Lisbon we will be able to translate these goals, which for now are merely theoretical, into concrete actions.
The Commission has launched numerous studies on this issue, and the results of these investigations can be consulted on our website.
In spite of the relatively numerous operations, there is still an evident divorce between the instruments we are equipping us with - see the battle-groups, for instance - and the improvised collection of national means we actually employ, when the EU is required to intervene.
Mr President, on 25 April 2011, the United Nations made public the advisory report of the panel of experts appointed by the UN Secretary-General on accountability in relation to the armed conflict in Sri Lanka.
Therefore we should exploit this potential of the European budget to its limits.
Consequently, all labour market players, including those from the professional sectors, businesses, trade unions, ministries and public employment services, should engage in a structured dialogue on how to guarantee professional integration of the young, promote formalinformal training and ultimately develop an education system in the EU which is able to provide career security for our young people.
Does the Commission agree that payments should be reviewed if a region has been receiving structural funding for years without this resulting in it meeting the targets set
In particular, I voted in favour of the Ferreira report because I believe that the emphasis on the role of the scoreboard, as an instrument for identifying possible imbalances by means of specific criteria, is an excellent basis on which to analyse the problem.
In my opinion it is good that the Commission wants to continue working on this. I would like to call on Commissioner Barnier, who promised us that the Commission would take a more energetic approach, to adopt measures to improve this situation.
I also have to say that at this time, in the wake of the Fukushima accident, our work has been extremely difficult and I am pleased that, despite these difficult times, the text adopted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy ITRE has been prepared to an adequate standard and that we did not get carried away with ideological debates.
Free movement is also a great boost and a benefit for the Internal Market, so safeguarding this achievement is key to the Commission and an absolute priority for me personally.
Moreover, we do not yet know how the other countries within the WTO will act and whether they will ultimately give their consent.
Although prevention is better than cure, we will also be better placed to take action to correct these situations if they do emerge.
Following long negotiations between the various institutions, this new legal framework will ensure clear and common conditions for citizens and businesses in the EU. Cross-border commercial transactions and online transactions are now harmonised, so ensuring greater security and transparency for EU consumers and businesses.
Thirdly, we believe it is important that, when other measures are taken in this region, whether these are additional car parks or other developments, a special screening of the entire project is carried out which includes existing developed areas and existing building projects.
Where coordination takes the form of an international agreement, participation of the European Union as a Party is necessary to the extent that the agreement covers matters falling within the Union's competence.
The Treaty of Lisbon came into force at a time when many bilateral investment agreements with third countries were coming to an end and no transitional arrangements had been established to ensure an integrated move towards future agreements within the exclusive competence of the European Union. I think it is a good idea to undertake a reliable evaluation of all the bilateral agreements currently in force with third countries, and to adopt a strategy common to all Member States.
We believe, therefore, that effective coordination will bring real benefits from the point of view of efficiency and improvements to sound budgetary management.
This would have a highly counterproductive impact on the future of the EU and would make it difficult to agree on a common European approach or attitude to important issues, as the crisis in Libya has demonstrated.
There is perhaps not a single MEP who doubts the need for cohesion policy to continue after 2013.
Mr President, honourable Members, the European Union is working closely together with the United States of America in the war against terror.
At the time of this agreement's review, we would like to reiterate that the interests of the movement of capital should not be promoted at the expense of safeguarding the rights of people and workers.
Between legal fees, translation fees and implementation fees, it can cost small businesses up to EUR 15 000 to enter the e-commerce market of just one Member State.
In particular, efforts should be made to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of rules of origin so that products from other North American Free Trade Agreement members do not follow in the wake of Canadian products.
That is precisely what is not being tested. I live on the border with France and Luxembourg and there are four nuclear power stations in Cattenom.
At present, research into low doses of radiation is the subject of a large-scale initiative as part of a joint programme planned by the European MELODI platform.
Finally, we very often emphasise in Parliament that people are the most important.
In a changing world, our Union needs to be more than a purely economic Union.
As regards the specific situation in Croatia, it is a transit route through which illicit drugs are smuggled on their way from the producer countries to consumer countries.
We should be establishing standards in this area together with the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA. We need standards which quite simply guarantee the highest possible level of safety and which ultimately give us the opportunity to avoid putting the population at risk as far as possible.
Any additional charges on Irish hauliers would have a major negative impact on our exports. I think I am supported by the Spanish, the Portuguese and also the Italians.
Obviously, we also have to admit that the civilian population is a victim in this kind of conflict, and the UN panel has shown clearly that there are responsibilities on both sides mainly that of the government but also that of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, and both need to be investigated.
For these reasons, amongst others, I have decided to vote in favour of this dossier.
We know that it is not the case, and for this reason I very much hope there will be serious consequences and that we will be able to tell the public that we are taking care of their safety and not just pretending that we are.
The Commission now has to move forward and prepare separate legislation to cover cloning. I only hope that MEPs will learn from their mistakes and realise that it is the people of Europe who suffer if we cannot agree on these key issues.
The second aspect relates to reciprocity of access to the public procurement markets.
The European Union has been calling for the closure of the detention camp at Guantanamo Bay for many years.
For instance, the reciprocity principle should be applied in the context of the legal remedies available in the event of commercial disputes, and there is a need to improve the protection of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, patents and geographical indications.
The smooth functioning of the Internal Market depends on the stability of the financial system and, consequently, on the trust put by the European public and consumers in financial institutions and transactions.
The dynamic development of satellite navigation systems in recent years is the result of both technological progress and market needs.
However, I would like to remind you that the coin has another side.
Global challenges, such as financial markets, energy security, combating poverty, climate change and human rights violations require joint and coordinated action.
For me, education must be a political priority.
That is why we are saying here that the euro area itself is under threat; that the future of the European Union could be its implosion, and that a change of policy is needed ...
Therefore, I expect a suitable proposal to be tabled by the Commission, which will primarily reflect the views of the Committee on Regional Development and the European Parliament.
Although the report is a step in the right direction, there is still more that needs to be done. I hope that this register - if it proves to be a success - will develop into a mandatory register of lobbyists. I agree with Mr Duff's proposal that rapporteurs should name the lobbyists that they have had contact with when drafting a law.
It is unfortunate that the Council has yet to grant the Commission a mandate to open negotiations on a global air transport agreement with important trading partners, such as the People's Republic of China and India, despite the proposal dating from 2005.
Of these, the international air transport agreements are of particular importance, given the various security and coordination needs involved.
Thirdly, in this report, we propose the early publication by the Commission of road maps of proposed legislation in order to give Parliament and the stakeholders the opportunity to express their opinions during the consultation period.
It is rather late to be considering this, but it is high time that we thought about the measures that need to be taken at a European level.
The EU has a role to play in promoting best management practice that suits the needs of local actors and communities, and in incentivising forestation efforts compatible with local conditions and native species.
The International Labour Organisation ILO is currently working on drawing up a convention on domestic workers.
We asked these heads of major Internet companies to tell us how they saw the future of this industry and, furthermore, we shared our concerns, our interests and our perception of the Internet with the different members of the G8. However, there was not really any negotiation in terms of specific results.
The PVV will thus also be voting against this recommendation.
This development makes it even more urgent to promote a mechanism of real participation.
At a time when the European economy is weak and competitiveness is more vital than ever, this principle may serve to make freight transport even more expensive, especially for outlying countries, for which the price of transportation is added to the cost of the goods.
In addition to considerations about the 'digital dividend' to be shared among Internet services that is to say, the 800 MHz band, we have to look to the future and survey the opportunities afforded by the next potential radio bands, such as the 700 MHz band.
I support this report, especially what it says about the Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the reform of the sugar sector.
Here I cannot accept the Commissioner's point of view that we should keep the two matters separate. I think they are linked in the eyes of the voters, and they are linked in my eyes. I would certainly not vote for an agreement unless this dispute is settled before we reach the final stages of this deal.
The Bulgaria-Turkey-Greece area is one of the most sensitive parts of the European Union's external borders in terms of illegal migration. I disagree with the rapporteur, Mr Coelho, in that the admission of the Republic of Bulgaria and of Romania to the Schengen area cannot be completed in the short term because of the deficiencies in the fields of equipment, performance of border checks, training of personnel and the obligation to exchange information.
Therefore, we will now invite the Member States to send representatives from the relevant authorities to us so that we can discuss with these authorities before the summer recess how we can incorporate the consequences of crime.
Units of measurement are essential in the use of all measuring instruments to express measurements or any indication of quantity.
In this regard, we still have an unresolved issue, but I hope that the Council will manage to hold a serious discussion on what this is actually about.
There is almost no nook or cranny of our national life so remote that Brussels has not curled its tendrils thither, choking out the natural light and blocking out the native growth.
The differentiation between people who are entitled to international protection, such as refugees, and economic migrants is extremely important, in order to protect those who really need to be protected.
This European Parliament resolution of 9 June 2011 on misleading business directories warns the Commission of the need to step up its activities regarding the revision and improvement of the directive and other relevant legislation in order to put an end, as soon as possible, to the misleading practices used by publishers of business directories, namely, through the compilation of a specific blacklist of misleading practices used in business directories.
For the vast majority of European citizens, the right to move freely is the embodiment of the European project and one of the most tangible results of the European Union, and I am pleased to say that most Europeans use their right to the full - people make around 1.25 billion journeys as tourists within the European Union countries every year.
Finally, the rapporteur also covered one fundamental issue opposition to absolute strategic autonomy as the final outcome of the CSDP.
By the way, this Parliament has been discussing this for ten years, but the experts outside have been discussing it for 30 years.
Something else which has not been made clear is how the costs of maintaining the Galileo system will be financed.
Therefore, it is an absolute requirement that we reduce administrative formalities and put in place a modern administration adapted to the needs of SMEs.
These instruments provide for minimum standards which should underpin the adoption of measures by States in order to monitor, control and inspect foreign-flagged fishing vessels wishing to use their harbours.
Objective 3 must be maintained and, even more importantly, developed, so that we can pursue the integration of Community territory across national borders.
To this extent, I failed to understand the meaning of your question, but what I believe I can glean from it is that you also support democracy. I suppose that this represents some sort of progress.
The Treaties, in Articles 6 and 7, make it crystal clear not only that the Union and the Member States share certain values, but that the Commission has the duty to police respect for those values.
Politically, the EU should insist more strongly that political parties in Madagascar rise above their obvious conflicts and agree on the road map proposed by the Southern African Development Community to overcome the crisis.
In the interests of safety, it is essential for the rules on the operating space, driving position and door and window sizes of agricultural tractors to be codified in a manner that is comprehensible and accessible to citizens. I therefore voted in favour.
Many have benefited from it already and will do so into the future, but one thing is vital and that is that there is mutual recognition in all Member States of qualifications and diplomas.
The case for it has not been proven.
It is important that this cohesion be economic, social and territorial, and that it support the poorest regions. I consider it essential that funding for cohesion policy be at least maintained at the same levels.
I should also mention that, if the summit leaders decide to go ahead with the option of a comprehensive bilateral legal framework, this should include both trade and investment relations and political relations and cooperation.
We broadly supported the draft report and submitted a series of amendments which have mostly been included, for instance an emphasis on green priority objectives energy and climate change, resource efficiency, regeneration of biological resources and promoting social cohesion; addressing eco-innovation at all stages, including design, through the adoption of a properly funded and ambitious eco-innovation action plan, as well as the adoption of a strategy for promoting productservice systems and function-oriented business models; promoting the use of open standards as drivers for innovation and open access to publicly funded research, as well as focusing public financing on socially valuable fields where knowledge is created as a public good, such as inducement prizes in the health sector we also tried, with varying degrees of success, to propose better wording for IPR issues; we managed to retain the wording welcoming the Commission's efforts to prevent IPR from constituting a barrier to competition and innovation.
I would also like to underscore the profound need for additional investment, both in research into nuclear power and in other important research aimed at anticipating and combating accidents and their adverse effects in the future.
I endorsed this document, because the Committee responsible decided to approve the closure of the accounts of the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions for the financial year 2009.
It is now the European Commission's turn to take into account in its legislative proposal the European Parliament's opinion. I should stress in particular that the development of a competitive agricultural sector and economic and social cohesion should be maintained as priorities for the period ahead. MEPs have also given their due attention to Europe's research efforts.
To conclude, let me say that the economic governance package gives us a chance that the winnerloser attitude will disappear from our European reality and that Europe will not become a zero sum game.
On the other hand, we know that there are exceptions where export is allowed.
Indeed, the economic development of an area has various dimensions that are not included in GDP, which takes a snapshot of a given moment.
This report has been adopted, taking into account the fact that, during the necessary negotiations, the rapporteur had the opportunity to ensure that a review clause would be included in the regulation, concerning the possibility of introducing new models covering a variety of environmental goods following an implementation report by the Commission.
My last point is that I visited Mannheim last year.
On Syria, for example, what are you convinced of Should Assad be included or not What is your opinion We would like to hear that.
The Commission, in a spirit of compromise, and in order to ensure the immediate adoption of that proposal, can accept the substitution of the obligatory provision on correlation tables included in the text with the relevant recital encouraging Member States to follow this practice.
Signature of acts adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure see Minutes
The success and effectiveness of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative depends, to a large extent, on the attitude and key activities of Member States and the financial support they provide for the implementation of these programmes at a national level, which could contribute to the social integration of young people.
Mr President, after over an hour spent debating the report by Mr Dess, I remain very optimistic, not only about tomorrow's vote and the support for a report which, as I said in my introductory remarks, is very similar to the proposals contained in the Commission communication from the end of last year, but also about our future common agricultural policy.
Both initiatives are testament to the great importance that the Committee on International Trade and, in our view, Parliament, should place on this matter.
European regulation of the issue which you are rightly complaining about on the basis of practical experience was not wanted at the time.
Madam President, I would just like to ask for a little clarification from colleagues on that side of the House, because in the debate, you have firmly insisted on the right of every Member State to pass laws as it deems fit, as long as it has a democratic majority, and that those laws should be recognised by other countries.
As we continue to cooperate with the affected countries, my greatest wish is that we should establish workshops for future technology there, and provide advice on how to save energy and develop alternative energy sources.
The timing is particularly appropriate with a sharp increase being noticed in the number of political and humanitarian crises in the world, which gives rise to the need for the European Union to deploy its foreign policy instruments more effectively so as to ensure better use of its leverage in international organisations and to take the lead more effectively in resolving current and future international crises.
The main aims of the radio spectrum policy programme are broadband access for the entire EU by 2013 and fast Internet connections by 2020.
The forests and the forestry industry are already making a significant contribution to the production of local raw materials.
The Committee on Transport and Tourism has therefore decided to table this own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated in terms of substance, and of the procedures the committee might adopt in order to remain well informed throughout the course of negotiations and so that it has an opportunity to express its priorities well before being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it. Parliament's new powers, provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, bring with them a new responsibility to ensure that Parliament and its competent committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent.
However, when it comes to generating European added value, as we have done in many areas, we need to work together to develop this because, when they go it alone, the national states are weaker in the face of international competition.
They have met both the shadow rapporteurs and the lead rapporteur on several occasions and, thanks to their constructive dialogue, I think that we have achieved a great deal.
However, I also challenge you to give your full attention to Union legislation to guarantee labour, salary, maternity and illness protection, and social security rights for domestic workers, both male and female.
The report for 2010 confirmed my beliefs regarding Cedefop's effectiveness.
Therefore, I would like to urge the Commission, once again, to consider an EU-wide ban on these misleading business directories.
Now the last impediment is being removed to enable the Swedish Social Democrats to be instrumental in Sweden becoming a member of the Euro Plus Pact.
Enhanced cooperation and good-neighbourly relations between the European Union and Russia are of major importance for the stability, security and prosperity of Europe and beyond.
These 'exceptional trade measures' with the partners in the Western Balkans, under the EU Stabilisation and Association process, are indeed preferential tariff measures which guarantee easier access to the EU market for the partner countries' exports.
If, today, we bring in economic sanctions, we can expect that the scandalous trials and the scandalous repression will finally end, because it is only this language which Lukashenko understands.
My personal view is that it is important, in this context, for us to convey a clear message to the European Union's other trade partners.
So, as regards restoring internal borders, we think that it can be done only in an exceptional situation, in case of an extraordinary challenge, for a defined period and by the decision of the Community. I have said this in my introduction, Mrs Malmstrom and Mr Barroso have said this as well. I repeat once again that this is our starting point.
Added to which, despite the progress made in recent years, the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Framework Programme should be stepped up in order to develop the skills that would allow them to boost their competitiveness.
We call on him to end this futile crackdown, to release all political prisoners and instead to restore Belarus to the path of genuine, pluralist, multi-party democracy.
Ladies and gentlemen, imagine what the reaction of the Union would be if Serbia, for example, decided today to grant citizenship en masse to citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, or if Albania granted citizenship to citizens of Macedonia. I would like to say one more time that only in a situation where there is mutual respect for values and cooperation can we talk about continuing the joint development of the European Union in the future.
Given that the agreed text is acknowledged as better than the Council general approach, this does not make sense.
- The next item is the joint debate on the following reports
Private investors are too often reluctant when it comes to funding SMEs.
Even if all nuclear reactors were shut down tomorrow, there would still be a legacy of waste from half a century of nuclear generation and from a variety of other activities.
The EU decided to set up its own global navigation satellite system for two key reasons firstly, Europe's independence from other global navigation systems and autonomy, and secondly, to gain a share in this fast growing worldwide high-tech market, which today, to a large extent, is dominated by the US. I agree that there should be a broad and comprehensive debate at political level about the desired level of ambition deciding the level of services provided and the financial resources available whereby a political choice would need to be made between a purely EU funded programme and one allowing national or private contributions. The result of this debate will impact the policy options for the future governance and management of the GNSS systems.
The Schengen area and, in particular, freedom of movement, is an acquis communautaire that genuinely means something to our citizens.
Until then, this piece of legislation will allow rapid authorisation of new textile fibres.
In the Internal Market created by the European Union, it is becoming increasingly necessary to defend the rights of consumers, particular those lacking adequate resources.
Flexible rules for sanctions, complaints and compensation mechanisms are necessary in order to adapt to the changing market conditions and new market practices.
We therefore regret that the call for point 31 - 'Stresses that no directive regulating CSR and enforcing respect for it should be adopted at EU level' - to be removed has been rejected.
The coordination of 27 different foreign and security policies is not the easiest of tasks, and you cannot blame the captain alone for the shipwreck.
In the wake of the global financial crisis, it is very important to realise the full potential of the Internal Market, and thus help meet the strategic goals of the Europe 2020 strategy.
We will create a network of good practices and innovation at European level, a network containing researchers, consultants, instructors, farmers and the food production industry, in order to ensure that we can shorten the chain from the production of knowledge to its use in practice.
Let us merge where we are strong; let us in Europe bring together the spirit of research, Einstein and Steve Jobs.
Furthermore, as a result of the brutal austerity, in many countries, it is virtually impossible for young people to get a decent job after finishing education. A quarter of young people in Ireland are now unemployed and 1 000 people emigrate every week, so for many Irish families, the very notion of Youth on the Move has a very different meaning.
Judging from the previous speeches, I think that to ask the question is partly to answer it. Europe is struggling to do as well as it might, and we know the main reasons for this, as they have been pointed out there is, broadly speaking, a North-South divide in Europe where research and development are concerned; Europe is also lagging behind in terms of research and development spending by businesses; and researchers and SMEs have difficulty in accessing the various programmes, as our rapporteur mentioned.
The list could go on to include media censorship, keeping the nation in poverty, unlawful arrests, disappearances and torture.
The Agreement will not only make the Canadian and European markets more competitive, it will also make them safer for passengers and cargo flights, as it promotes cooperation in all matters of certification, inspections and enforcement.
The advantages of the European Arrest Warrant by far outweigh any possible inconveniences.
The consequences for the health and welfare of those who handle this waste in a very inappropriate way are extremely serious.
Some Member States have that and others might not have it, but the fact is that in the new constitution, the government of Hungary has abolished this symbolic Ombudsman.
It is about time that the message sank in that feeble political will is not the answer to this crisis and makes solutions more expensive.
A recent study highlights that in the United States, almost half of the samples of meat tested in stores contained Staphylococcus aureus, half of which were resistant to at least three classes of antibiotics.
This is piffle The Liberal Democrats' commitment to civil liberties comes to a grinding halt at Calais.
'Finally' because, after very lengthy negotiations, we have reached a compromise and the 'polluter pays' principle is now genuinely beginning to take shape in this dossier.
Since the agricultural sector is of fundamental importance, we urge the Commission to negotiate an agreement that is beneficial for producers and consumers alike, and which ensures fair competition between providers of agricultural products from the European Union and Canada.
Secondly, the case does not come within the scope of Bruno Gollnisch's political activities as member of the European Parliament.
I voted in favour of granting 2009 discharge to the Joint Undertaking for the Implementation of the Joint Technology Initiative on Innovative Medicines because, as the report shows, the Court of Auditors has deemed the Undertaking's accounts and the underlying transactions to be reliable. I think, however, that even though it is to some extent justifiable as it is still in the start-up phase, the Undertaking should complete the implementation of its control systems and operate more carefully and transparently in the coming years.
A profound change in current trade policy is urgently needed, steering international trade towards complementarity and not competition, towards the establishment of fair and equitable economic relationships that are mutually advantageous, and which serve the development of countries and their peoples, and not just a few companies and financial institutions.
I am familiar with the issues of pollution mentioned in this report and I take them very seriously, but additional charges for air and noise pollution are not the answer.
On the other hand, I must say that it is rather unfortunate that we have put the urgent issues of Azerbaijan and Belarus one after the other - one week after Azerbaijan became - and was welcomed as - a founder of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly together with us, the European Parliament.
The proposals on the multiannual framework, as I said in my introduction, will be forthcoming in June, and only after that, in the autumn, will the Commission table legislative proposals.
In order to combat these abuses within the legislative process, we call for a clear methodology, an analysis of alternatives and the option not to take any action, as well as maximum transparency and the close involvement of Parliament.
What explains your great impatience and determination to see a European appointed if not your desire to take this step, which you tell us is not urgent and can keep for another day If we want to make a go of multilateralism, then we ourselves need to set an example, be consistent and show how well it can work in the future, because the IMF has an absolutely crucial role to play in the field of global governance, a role that transcends the issue of European debt and of the sovereign debt situations of the European countries that are struggling.
There is a fundamental contradiction in the European Commission's proposal to grant further financial assistance to Georgia it was the Commission itself that pointed out that Georgia's economy was recovering after the conflict with Russia three years ago, thereby insinuating that there was no need to 'assist' the Georgian Government with further funds to help the national economy in addition to those already provided in recent years.
The European Parliament's seat in Strasbourg is a question of European identity, not just a question of saving money. I am discussing this today, in this House, during the debate on the 2009 discharge because the symbol of Franco-German reconciliation is being treated by some members of the Committee on Budgetary Control as a blessing, as an easy way to cut costs.
In my view, there will be no multiannual budgets from 2014 onward so long as those declarations from Member States are not given.
I voted for this resolution which calls on both sides in Sudan, in the run-up to independence day on 9 July 2011, to present concrete plans on the setting-up andor reform of their institutions in order for the two states to be viable as of that date.
By voting against the report, I intend to show my opposition to its proposed future scenario in which national diplomacy would substantially be superseded by Union diplomacy, to the detriment of the Member States' diplomatic autonomy.
Firstly, on the extraction of oil sands, which damages local diversity, we insist on the EU's right to use the Fuel Quality Directive to inhibit their use. I was pleased to hear what the Commissioner had to say on that matter.
Moreover, the French initiative aiming at consolidating the financing of the southern neighbourhood at the expense of the eastern neighbourhood sent a disastrous message to our eastern partners.
I fully support the adoption, ratification and implementation of a convention on domestic work by the International Labour Organisation ILO. For the most part, domestic workers work under precarious conditions, frequently find themselves in legally dubious administrative situations which make their situation even less stable, and are often victims of discrimination, inequality and unfair or abusive treatment.
Our implementing partners have the authority to decide what the most appropriate food assistance needs are in any specific circumstance.
Finally, I would like to stress that, in the current circumstances, Syria's application for a seat on the UN's Human Rights Council is unacceptable.
I have to say that both the inspection report and the opinion of the rapporteur himself are positive, and that we should thank them, while, at the same time, also expressing our exasperation.
As far back as 2005, the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, pledged that all the rights of journalists would be respected and that they would be able to count on help in the event of any kind of danger.
In the European Parliament, we are calling for specific action - for the European Commission to recognise the creative sector as one of the most productive areas of the Union economy and so to treat its development as an absolute priority.
At the same time, European Union countries must also be aware that it is in their interest for Romania and Bulgaria to join Schengen because they will be able to make their own contribution to the security of all Member States and extend the Schengen area, which is set to strengthen the integration process within the European Union and the common area of freedom, security and justice.
On the contrary, investment subsidies under the second pillar will promote a keenness and a willingness for innovation.
Without such a timeline, the regulation would allow parallel, potentially incompatible investment schemes to emerge.
The Chair, the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs have all represented this House with great distinction.
Undoubtedly, then, this is an ambitious report, given the issues it tackles, from intellectual property rights to increased cooperation among the Member States and the Commission. I would therefore congratulate the rapporteur on her commitment and hope that, with more such contributions, we will be able to achieve all the objectives proposed in the Europe 2020 strategy.
The Committee on Industry, Research and Energy ITRE is very much in favour of the idea of a European directive, but we want it to be more rigorous in certain places.
The economic integration of the European Union and in particular the euro has reached a juncture at which one can no longer turn a blind eye to unequivocal deviations from the criteria that have been set in order to safeguard economic stability in the Union.
The importance of the transport sector to the European economy is reflected in the employment that it directly provides for more than 10 million people and in the 5 of gross domestic product GDP that it represents.
Mr President, allow me to conclude by saying that, rather than to appeal for the Guantanamo base to be closed, it would be more to the point to call for the restoration of Cuba's sovereignty over this part of her territory, which is illegally occupied by the United States.
This second tranche of the EU's macro-financial assistance - the first having been implemented back in 2009-2010 - is intended to help Georgia meet its external financing requirement and is subject to strict conditions.
Moreover, there is already an example of good practice our presence in the World Trade Organisation WTO. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the EU to be represented with a single voice in the various international bodies. I think that drawing up a White Paper on this subject, as is proposed in the report, could be a good 'beginning of the end' for this bizarre situation.
The report has also persuaded me that European solidarity should be strengthened by the creation of intermediate regions in order to ensure that the cohesion policy provides fair coverage for the whole of Europe.
Let us work for a more autonomous, EU-centred foreign and security strategy, because that is what European citizens expect from us and that is what we should deliver to them.
Regulation EC No 154198 and Regulation EEC No 303093, which were initially adopted in order to implement trade policy measures in the textile sector, have now become obsolete instruments that constrain the free market and are poorly adapted to changes in the new regulatory environment.
Whilst clearing away the ruins left by your Hungarian Socialist colleagues, we are mobilising tremendous energies to make Hungary a democratic, European, and free country based on the constitutional mandate we received from the Hungarian citizens in free elections.
We hope that before long, we will know more about aspects of food safety due to scientific research and progress. I am pleased that Commissioner Dalli promised that there will be a new, separate draft on cloning and the subject of cloned products soon.
For this very reason, although there is a long tradition of EU legislation on such contracts, it will never be going too far to call for better, more effective laws that guarantee the total transparency of procedures; that prevent all forms of corruption or manipulation of proposals to benefit one candidate; that put a ceiling in terms of numbers and of value on the number of awards without a call for proposals or without negotiation; and that guarantee proper competition on the Internal Market between candidate companies, irrespective of their country of origin.
The main opposition Internet information site has had its access blocked by the judicial authorities, while access to refugee camps is still currently extremely restricted, including for the United Nations.
With today's resolution, Parliament postpones the decision to grant discharge to the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency for the execution of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
In addition, the package we put forward last week urges rational reflection, taking into account short-term needs for strengthened external borders as well as a broader approach to asylum and migration.
To ensure that this is not an idle notion, I think that we must put our trust in the local authorities and elected representatives of those cities.
We are also responsible for making the implications clear to the European public, which is why the involvement of Parliament in the issuing of the mandate, as called for by several of my fellow Members, must be central.
Another very important question is the matter of energy sources and the costs which will be borne by EU Member States when paying Russia for them. A resolution to the question of the ban on imports of vegetables from the EU to the Russian market is urgent.
The one in ten which succeeds pays for all the rest, but the motto is 'fail fast'. There is much we can learn about how we could better support our own innovative small businesses in Europe.
Having purchased a huge amount of Greek Government bonds, and also having accepted much as collateral, the ECB is now trapped.
Several months ago, we raised the alarm concerning swine flu.
When 14 million farmers are feeding 500 million people, is it too much to ask that European agricultural policy be used to ensure that the 500 million people also provide properly for the 14 million farmers, so to speak
I voted for this report because I believe that the cultural and creative industries should constitute an added value for the Union. A European statute for artists based on favourable working conditions and tax regimes would promote Europe as a dynamic and challenging environment in which to live and work, making it attractive to skilled and creative individuals.
For the immediate future, the EU and the Member States should focus their resources on finding the source of the contamination in order to end the outbreak and the deaths that it has caused, and to restore consumer confidence in the food chain, as without this, it is impossible to put an end to our farmers' desperation.
We all know that it is a prerequisite for incorruptibility, for reputable work by the police, that they must be well paid. I therefore hope that my information is inaccurate and that the police, who are performing a service in the interests of these countries and of the security of the entire European Union, will continue to be well paid in the future, too, so that they are not susceptible to bribery.
Trade relations between European countries and Japan go back several centuries and have been growing closer since the end of the Second World War.
The amendment of the regulation governing the ERDF extending the eligibility of housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities enables Member States to revise their Operational Programmes and re-prioritise their investments, by using maximum 2 of their total ERDF allocation for housing interventions in favour of marginalised communities for both replacement and renovation.
The European Union and Japan are industrial giants that share democratic values and together represent 38.5 of the world's gross domestic product.
That is exactly what they do, and nothing could be rewarded less in the prices currently being achieved at market.
Evaluations have concluded that most stocks in Mauritania are either fully exploited or over-exploited and, therefore, the Commission must discuss with Mauritania the development of long-term fisheries management plans that would include all fishery allocations by the Mauritanian authorities, to both their national fleets and third-country fleets, in order to ensure the sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources.
Given that it is actually the job of the Commission President to represent the Commission, we are anxious for Mr Barroso to be present at 1500 on Tuesday afternoon. I apologise for having mixed up Tuesday and Wednesday.
The current revision of the EIA Directive should also include a debate on a review of the uniform procedure for public participation which is actually laid down in the directive.
I abstained when voting on this report, despite the critical look it takes at European policies, particularly those carried out by the Member States, aimed at young people.
On such a sensitive and serious food safety issue, it is not acceptable just to dab on a touch of face powder to look good to the consumers.
In a country such as France, however, we also know that we will need 20 to 25 years to phase out nuclear power, and the latest studies giving the statistics on serious nuclear accidents predict that there will be an accident somewhere in the world within the next fifteen years.
These issues are the subject of other evaluations, such as the European Commission's Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. I want to welcome also the suggestions made by Commissioner Malmstrom yesterday regarding a new package of anti-corruption measures.
The European Court of Auditors reports a significant percentage of irregularities affecting different policy areas, averaging 2.8 of the budget year after year, and we continue to flow funds to these regions.
We need greater transparency and we must also try to make the most of the opportunities presented by the modern media and, in particular, the Internet.
As well as social standards, corporate social responsibility should contribute to sustainable growth, but companies should not avoid dialogue with employees and they must respect and promote decent employment relations, encourage employee participation through consultation and information and through collective bargaining, develop vocational skills and lifelong learning, comply with work safety standards, promote equality of men and women, create a proper environment for social partners to anticipate and manage changes that have taken place in the labour market, including restructuring, improve the quality of work, and integrate and protect vulnerable groups of workers, such as young people, the elderly, disabled people and migrants.
It has become an important mainstay of the European unification process.
We cannot build walls like these between the decisionmakers and the people and alienate one from the other in this way.
Madam President, Mrs Geoghegan-Quinn, ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here to evaluate the Seventh Framework Programme for research 2007-2013, which has a budget of EUR 51 billion.
The judicial authorities are, in many cases, inactive, and we therefore need to support through our resolution UN efforts to uphold the law and establish accountability for the killing and torture of thousands of civilians during the vicious fighting between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and government forces in Sri Lanka.
It should be remembered that GDP is a measure of production and does not measure environmental sustainability for example.
The output of solar power stations thus fluctuates considerably over the course of a day and during the year. I support the conclusions of the report by the Confederal Group of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left, but they must necessarily be followed up a detailed analysis of the plans.
Mr President, my own constituency has a long history of combining the promotion of the Welsh language to the young generation with artistic and technical talents to produce animated programmes like Sally Mally, Super Ted and Sam Tan. Today, this past has been reinvigorated by new productions such as Dr Who and Torchwood, so that Wales is quickly becoming known as a centre for cultural excellence with regard to film and programme production, as well as being home to newer creative areas, like the hugely profitable gaming industry.
The internal market is thus still not a single market as far as the digital environment is concerned, and the Council has thus missed a great opportunity.
As with Mr Lyon's report one year ago and Mr Garriga Polledo's report on the financial perspectives last month, tomorrow we will be voting in favour of maintaining the agricultural budget for the 2014-2020 programming period. I am sure that it will be a close-run thing, but we do need to take a stand and to make choices, because we will not have the money to do everything ...
However, I call on the Centre to take more effective measures to remedy its constant rise in surplus; I note, in fact, that for several years the Centre has had an accumulated budget surplus contrary to Regulation EC No 296594, and that in 2009 the surplus amounted to EUR 24 000 000, whereas it had been EUR 26 700 000 in 2008, EUR 16 900 000 in 2006, EUR 10 500 000 in 2005 and EUR 3 500 000 in 2004; I observe that this surplus is mainly linked to the lack of precision in the forecasts for translation requests received from its clients. I welcome, nevertheless, the Centre's initiative to refund EUR 11 000 000 to its clients in 2009; and I stress that similarly, in 2007, the Centre had already refunded EUR 9 300 000 to its clients
We have to work with all the countries which have adopted the convention in order to ensure that it is implemented.
In contrast, Croatia and Serbia must first haul their war criminals before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague before the Copenhagen criteria can even come into play.
As we well know, the main result of research is knowledge, followed by the opportunity to enhance that result in the economic sector, or indeed the industrial sector. A clear distinction must be made, then, between the manipulation and the enhancement of fundamental research.
It calls for the introduction of a degressive model of direct payments according to the size of an agricultural holding that are reserved exclusively for active farmers who use farmland for production and maintain it in a good agricultural and environmental condition. A step is thus being made towards halting the awarding of absurd subsidies to feudal landowners.
Lastly, it is important to develop transparent and efficient instruments that can help farmers to run short production chains, promote quality and provide information to consumers, thereby promoting fair and transparent price formation.
We cannot have priorities being specified in one committee and these then being ignored in other committees.
The Council is striving to achieve this and is encouraging Member States to do so because it would be a great weight off the shoulders of small and medium-sized enterprises and would greatly improve their liquidity.
All of us take an oath, when we assume our duties, saying that we are not there to represent countries, and, in fact, the credibility of the institution comes exactly from that fact - that we try to be independent and to serve the general European interest. I can tell you that the Member States, including the UK, are very well represented in the European Council by their Prime Ministers and in the Council by the various ministers.
In the same way the financial crisis played perfectly into their hands and they leapt at the chance to justify economic governance rather than admit the euro's failure, concerns about the sudden influx of migrants and the stresses it puts on countries is being used to call for the reinforcement of Schengen with increased centralised governance. MEPs are elected by the people, as the voice of the people.
While I am not sure that we need a legislative initiative prohibiting building on land cleared by fires, I am in favour of discussing robust, long-term solutions to help curb this terrible phenomenon of forest fires caused by arsonists wanting to clear land for building.
One day, you should have a European budget that is strong enough to compete out there in the global world; the guys are going to be very tough out there.
With increasing consumption rates, the depletion of fossil fuels is becoming inevitable and we should therefore increase investment in further research and in the development of sustainable transportation.
In April, they carried out a series of attacks on Christian buildings in Beni Ahmad, Bashtil and Kamadir.
National governments are responsible for detention issues and prison management, but the Commission's role is to make sure that judicial cooperation works and fundamental rights of all citizens are upheld.
This is not a good enough formula for tackling the crisis and it is destined to make it worse.
It is therefore very important for Member States to create specific conditions for access to early years learning for children whose families do not, for various reasons, provide them with the sort of material and family support that would enable them to take part in the standard education system without major problems.
One is to all act alone, trying to reconcile spending and income, in some cases, according to what I have heard, worshiping austerity as an ends in its own right, making swingeing cuts to public spending and social benefits, thereby exacerbating the situation for citizens.
Russia needs to be aware that the world, and the democratic world in Europe in particular, will be watching closely to see how these elections are carried out; whether the parties are registered correctly and fairly; and also whether certain individuals or certain parties are excluded from the elections at the outset.
Although we are grateful for your contribution Mr Barnier, you have not explained why the risks associated with government bonds are recorded in the trading book, but not in the banking book.
Finally, one of the most important disadvantages of the report is that it calls for the Member States to ensure 'mutual recognition of certificates and diplomas among the Member States', thereby putting pressure on them to recognise diplomas from various Greek or foreign colleges as 'equivalent' to a degree from a State university.
The validity of the trade preferences should not be terminated because this could have negative consequences on the overall economic performances of the Western Balkans, with consequent negative repercussions on their domestic reform and transition processes.
Mr President, I have here the letter from the representative of Her Majesty's Government on the SURE report.
So climate change and women is very much on the agenda.
I voted in favour of this report as it significantly improves cooperation between committees, as part of the necessary parliamentary reform.
Following various reports and in-depth debates, Parliament launched its register for representatives of interest groups in 1996.
The governments of certain Member States have crossed the boundaries of the rule of law, which were previously considered to be inviolable; they are restricting the freedom of the press, which is essential for the implementation of real democracy.
Then there is the question of balancing the interests of the economy and the environment. I believe that innovation, in particular in the area of the environment, offers significant opportunities for engineers and technicians, for adding value in a variety of ways and, therefore, for creating jobs.
Resource and food prices are also rising, at least if you disregard the most recent ups and downs.
If we do not succeed in stopping this in all the Member States and in implementing the directive uniformly and effectively throughout Europe, even greater damage will be caused.
Madam President, the new fundamental law of Hungary - one would say a far too controversial text for a constitution - has been rushed through the Hungarian Parliament after only one month of public consultations.
As to the Dublin Regulation and the Eurodac Regulation, important progress has been made at technical level.
Moreover, in terms of the economy too, free movement is central to the success of the Single Market and Europe's continued efforts to boost growth and jobs.
We are united in our determination to uphold the principles on which our Union is founded, against any populist temptation.
Otherwise, we will have summits with no real content, and that would not be good either.
This is precisely why I think that it must be much more accessible for potential partners in the private sector, who we really need to give the opportunity to become full partners in territorial cooperation projects.
We politicians have, unfortunately, also used this type of argument. I am calling on everyone to work on raising awareness and to acknowledge on both sides that we need to preserve the environment in order for the economy to continue functioning effectively in future.
Secondly, the public domain, and more specifically the European Union and its Member States, as well as nuclear industry operators, must adopt a behavioural ethic of total transparency in relation to nuclear activities.
The Consumer Rights Directive is now going to the final vote, following my vote in favour at the part-session in March 2011.
European urban diversity must be supported primarily by a flexible mechanism for implementing cohesion policy and by coordinating and adapting urban development projects according to the development needs and strategic guidelines of each city individually.
It is therefore clear that a comprehensive European answer is needed and two important elements of this, which are also top priorities for the Hungarian Presidency, are the European semester and implementing the reform of economic governance.
The right to cultural development and other fundamental rights is increasingly facilitated by these technologies.
With the slogan 'Chemistry - Our life, Our future', it is about making society more aware of chemistry's contribution to our well-being.
This grants the Director of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
We must ensure access to public services such as education, health services, transport services, sport and culture for citizens of rural areas.
An informal trialogue resolved the issue to permit adoption at first reading.
Madam President, I would like to thank colleagues for the very rich debate on the FTA negotiations with India.
Radio frequencies serve the public interest in a wide range of areas in the Member States.
We are also already planning the third batch, so the work is ongoing and will be continued.
I voted in favour of this document because I believe that the incentives for small business set out in the Small Business Act are the way to increase the competitiveness of the European Union.
This attack marked the severance of their previous alliance and the secret Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939, which divided up Europe.
However, the time when the West could assert its own interests without taking into consideration its partner nations and their people is long since past.
The Japanese Prime Minister has called for an 'open Japan' policy, and that is partly because he recognises that Japanese industry is stultifying in its present environment.
The need for these accounts arises because of the crucial functions the environment has in terms of economic performance and ensuring the welfare of the European Union's citizens.
Yet if the criminal law of the Member States is not sufficient, we will need to reread Articles 82 to 86 of the Treaty of Lisbon, reflect on whether we can consider the corruption of MEPs to be cross-border crime or an act otherwise detrimental to the Union's financial interests and determine whether or not to create a European Public Prosecutor, which would, moreover, be a significant step along the path to unity.
The multilateral trade system, based on rules and established through the World Trade Organisation WTO, remains the most suitable means of regulating and promoting open and fair trade.
I voted for the report on discharge of the European Parliament budget 2009, since it contributes to scrutiny of how funds are used by the European institutions. I believe that it would be useful to review the European Parliament budget in the long term, in order to reduce costs and create resources for the efficient functioning of the Parliament in the context of its increased competences arising from the Treaty of Lisbon.
Conciliation proceedings are most certainly a useful mechanism in the legislative process, but they become futile and pointless if participants are not prepared to negotiate and to compromise.
I support the resolution on the renewal of the protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the EU and Mauritania because the agreement is based on the principle of surplus, which is compatible with the EU's sustainable fishing strategy.
Last night's vote in the Greek Parliament allows the government to build consensus in support of the reform package, agreed with the European Union and IMF, of fiscal measures, privatisations and reforms that are necessary in Greece's journey back to growth.
Resistance to antibiotics represents an enormously serious problem which must be resolved immediately and effectively.
The decision on admitting Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area now remains a purely political one.
Baroness Ashton, the European Union must be ambitious. I hope that this proposal will appear in your White Paper.
According to the new report by the UN, it is very likely that the Tamil Tigers and government troops will be found guilty of serious violations of international humanitarian and human rights committed in the final stages of the conflict.
What steps will the EU take to ensure the referendum will be held fairly, with both sides being heard and equal amounts of money being spent I suspect that a free and fair referendum in not on the cards.
You know that, in the early warning system, the product and also the name of the producer must be named.
The UK has been politically taken over. UK law is made in Strasbourg, a monster red-tape factory is closing industry, and now we have tax but, because it is not football, the people are not informed.
The explanation I have so far been given for this situation is that research excellence is the main criterion for selection to the Seventh Framework Programme.
A responsible and flexible attitude is required of both the Council and Parliament, and I firmly believe that in today's situation, the agreement would send a remarkably positive message to the markets as well.
Dear colleagues, I would like to thank you all for your attention and solidarity, which the nations of the Baltic countries have been looking forward to for so many years.
Not just repealed, but invalid.
I support the report on the draft Council Regulation concerning the extension of the scope of the Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States.
Of these, I should like to stress the need for new and diversified lifelong learning, which is crucial for better-quality work, particularly in the context of jobs, as well as the need to pay particular attention to young people, to women and to the disabled, as set out in the Europe 2020 strategy.
When we investigated locally, we concluded that the provisions concerning environmental impact assessments, as applicable in Austria, were complied with at the time - at least in essence.
The reason why Member States can accept this formula at the moment - which, I must emphasise once again, is a significant progress compared to the previous years - is that lobby organisations do not approach the Council as a European institution, there have been very sporadic examples for that.
The possibility of introducing border controls already exists.
This grants the Commission discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the Eighth, Ninth and Tenth European Development Funds for the financial year 2009.
Democracy is based on people's freely expressed desire. I call on the Council and Commission to urge the authorities in Azerbaijan to respect human rights, especially those relating to the freedom of expression and peaceful demonstration, as well as to take concrete measures to combat corruption and reform the justice system.
In addition to the bail-out of these countries, and in addition to the financial aid, I would like to know which measures are being taken to relieve the burden of taxes, external demand and interest on these countries from a macro-economic perspective.
The government of Sri Lanka and the Commission have set up the LLRC to investigate human rights allegations.
Today in Madagascar, there is a transitional government that nevertheless holds no promise of anything good, either on an economic level, if we consider that people there live on less than one dollar a day, or on a humanitarian level.
These agreements can be split into three categories horizontal agreements, which align existing bilateral agreements; comprehensive agreements, which seek to ensure fair competition; and lastly, safety agreements, which are intended to ensure a high level of civil aviation safety.
Surely the answer to underfunding is not to invite in the private sector with all the distorting effect that has on education, or to impose fees that block access to hundreds of thousands across Europe, but for state investment to provide free well-funded education at all levels.
I want to inform the Commission and the Council that this is the start of Parliament's campaign to win new rights for our citizens who are the victims of fraud.
As politicians, we have a constant tendency, if we want to achieve something, to throw a new layer on top, additional regulation, an additional programme, an additional funding option.
This report also contains a number of worrying aspects, particularly when it demonstrates the desire to reform higher education curricula solely on the basis of market requirements, without going to the trouble of reaffirming the more general role of higher education with respect to the overall training of tomorrow's citizens.
Both countries are pursuing very ambitious programmes of fiscal consolidation, structural reform and financial repair.
But it is clear, and this was in the presentation by the rapporteur, that under the present unusual circumstances drafting and finding compromises on the 2012 budget cannot be 'business as usual'. Therefore, a balance between consolidation of public finances and investment conducive to growth and jobs is a must and I think this is visible in our draft.
All of this is starting to look ridiculous on the world stage.
This grants the Executive Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
By failing to provide accounts on the private and social cost of the use of natural resources and on the damage to the environment, conventional accounts may send the wrong progress message to the decision makers and this may put society on the road to non-sustainable growth.
This is an important political matter - as some people have rightly recognised - and it is a new chapter in the consideration of what we do in Europe year in year out.
The report by my colleague, Mr Audy, on the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union for research, technological development and demonstration activities FP7 reveals a low level of participation by SMEs and industry in general, a low number of female researchers and under-representation of certain Member States. I think it is necessary to develop effective coordination of research between the EU and national and regional authorities.
Next, will you condemn forthrightly and totally the passage of the Bahati bill in Uganda, which allows the execution of homosexuals
I therefore welcome the Member States' undertaking to reassign part of this revenue to the TEN-T, a major project designed to guarantee Europe's territorial cohesion and to improve access in regions such as those of the Alps, where the infrastructure is not sufficient to ensure a modal shift from road transport to other forms of transport.
And what are we talking about and promising Egypt One billion.
What we are discussing today is a report by the Secretary-General's panel of experts on accountability in Sri Lanka. I have not heard anyone in the Chamber as yet cast doubts on the intrinsic integrity of that report.
However, attempts to bind those of us outside the euro zone with targets and processes designed to harmonise economic policy are unacceptable. I do not wish to see the euro zone in prolonged difficulty, but the ECR cannot support EU legislation that transfers any further powers away from national governments who are currently outside of that euro zone.
In any event, my predecessor, Mrs Hubner, also put in place an action plan together with Parliament in this regard, the efficacy of which is already evident and which has shown its effect.
However, the EAW should be complemented with effective instruments for protecting defendants, with the presence of a lawyer and the right to translation, which Baroness Ludford has already tackled in her report, but also, and very crucially, the assessment of detention conditions in European prisons.
Mr President, Commissioner, no one could disagree with what you have said. I wish to relate the trouble suffered by a fellow Greek, who complained to me about a similar misadventure as the result of misleading advertising and gave me all the relevant documents.
We should never give credit to any authoritarian ruler by engaging in formal relations, even if we have done so in the past.
Later, in 2009 an agreement was adopted in Rome, and the intention now is to approve it on behalf of the EU.
Partners should talk to each other frequently, they should try to achieve consensus where possible, but should not hesitate to openly address more problematic aspects.
Similar conclusions are found in the Gualtieri report, which draws attention to the widespread overlapping of defence programmes and the consequent wasting of limited economic resources. NATO, therefore, continues to be the only effective force, and the Left-wing voices in Parliament, expressed in writing in a minority opinion and demanding, among other things, the dissolution of NATO, are dangerous and frankly anarchistic.
Some years ago, the group to which I belong defended the need to introduce safeguards on the use of the European Arrest Warrant and I am pleased to have heard you, Commissioner, this afternoon, mention improvements to the procedure through the creation of guides for the Member States as well as guides for detainees. I welcome this because I think that the European Arrest Warrant is very well understood by our fellow citizens, and is a crucial test in showing just what Europe is capable of in order to consolidate justice in Europe.
The Commission hopes that the Member States which still apply transitional measures to workers from Romania and Bulgaria will liberalise their labour markets when the second phase expires on 31 December 2011.
Finally, I would also like to congratulate the Member States on their efforts in putting together the first national strategy report, actively contributing to greater transparency, flexibility, effectiveness and accountability for cohesion policy funds.
I welcome the emerging trend for increased funding for scientific research in the European Union.
The Union is trying to equip itself with the right foreign policy tools appointment of a High Representative, creation of the European External Action Service. With its newly improved status, the Union will now be able to express its position within the United Nations General Assembly.
In particular, the economic advantages, as well as those in employment and innovation, are highlighted by the report on cultural and creative industries, which already account for almost 3 of Europe's gross product and employ 5 million people - a figure which rises to 7 if ancillary industries are taken into account.
This is an attempt to subvert the current international order, replacing it with a new, less democratic one that guarantees better conditions for big business and finance to pursue their ambitions in the endless contest for markets and resources.
In terms of culture, the EU can assist Member States in getting the best out of their policy priorities through exchanges of best practice and highlighting areas of importance, such as early years learning, the reduction of early school leaving and the promotion of vocational training.
Today, I voted in favour of creating 'intermediate regions', and I am pleased that this position was adopted by Parliament as a whole.
Russia must observe certain rules as regards the WTO.
Several of you referred to the Schengen area and to the importance of having high quality immigration policies in place. I would like to assure you that we are absolutely aware of the fact that freedom and the rights of persons to free movement within Europe is one of the most important achievements, and we should treasure it. The Commission will act as the guardian of the treaties and would be ready to act if the basic foundations of these projects are called into question.
In this regard, what is required is greater focus on support for the programme, a stronger connection with business requirements and better coordination with the EU's other financial instruments and with the Structural Funds.
Using the economic crisis as an excuse to weaken existing limit values when they have already entered into force sets an unfortunate precedent for other EU environmental legislation rewarding non-compliance and punishing those companies that have made the necessary investments to comply with the legislation in time.
From its beginnings until now, the CAP has undergone a number of reforms that testify to its support for agriculture that is constantly evolving in order to better respond to the numerous challenges that we have had to face. I welcome this vote, which is an achievement for the European Parliament.
The five original Member States have given way to the current 25 22 within the Union, and three outside it. Free movement is thus guaranteed within a territory of almost 43 000 km of external maritime borders and more than 7 700 km of land borders, covering 25 countries and 400 million people.
Our country has fulfilled, albeit late, all the technical requirements relating to external border controls.
Russia should not put pressure on Ukraine in this area by giving it the option of either joining the customs union with Kazakhstan and Belarus or paying a high energy price.
We must hold on to the foundation for defending intellectual property and, at the same time, take the necessary steps to be able to release the potential and creativity in modern technology.
We European partners would like to see in Azerbaijan an ongoing dialogue with civil society, a press which enjoys freedom of expression and can report without any political pressure so as to provide the public with correct information, as well as free, uncensored access to the Internet to facilitate communication between Azerbaijan and Europe.
In addition, it is noted that Sarajevo has a special place in European history and culture and will commemorate several important anniversaries in 2014, and the City Council of Sarajevo and local cultural operators have undertaken extensive preparations in their candidature for this title. I therefore believe that the Council should award the title of European Capital of Culture exceptionally to Sarajevo in 2014.
Mr President, it is becoming clear that administrations in some of the capitals in our Union now realise what the Treaty of Lisbon stands for and find it difficult to adopt a foreign policy initiative which does not come from them.
Also on the same day, 22 years ago, the first partly-free parliamentary elections took place in Central and Eastern Europe, in Poland, where candidates of the democratic opposition won, taking almost all the seats which were open to a free vote.
It is therefore right that the regulation on new foodstuffs includes a ban on the sale of cloned animals and their offspring. I do not believe it is highly complex to deal with the cloning issue now.
If Greece can demonstrate that it is genuinely committed to the reform package agreed with the European Union and the IMF, we will accompany Greece on its journey back to growth.
Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations are ambitious, they concern many economic sectors, but they are also a cause for concern in Europe and in India, as I was able to see during last month's meeting between the trade committee of the two chambers of the Indian Parliament and the European Parliament's delegation for relations with India.
In the EU's assessment, granting these trade preferences should only cause limited adverse effects on the Internal Market and should not affect negatively the least developed members of the World Trade Organisation WTO. Notwithstanding this, it must be expected that the unilateral suspension of duties will lead to infringement proceedings at the WTO.
It is a very positive development that the adoption of this directive will end the situation in Estonia in which vehicles from other countries do not pay the tax in Estonia, but our vehicles pay in other countries.
We have made an impact assessment.
In my answer, I highlighted the measures that have already been outlined in Europe 2020 and already they are making their way towards practice in various Member States through effective Commission programmes.
For example, we feel that this means banning wage dumping and tax dumping, or setting minimum standards to stop competition being distorted on the labour market.
Elsewhere it is dramatic in the Baltic States, Ireland, Greece and Slovakia, unemployment among young people stands at 30 or above.
Mobility, a system of recognising credits and other measures will limit the growth in unemployment among young people, which stands at an average of 21 in the EU today, which is an alarming figure.
We cannot understand why the European Union is going to charge Portugal higher interest rates than the International Monetary Fund.
I think this resolution on the EU-India Free Trade Agreement should be rejected.
Finally, I hope the EU recognises the importance of sport, both economically and socially, and will provide funds to boost sport at all levels, particularly as, since the Lisbon Treaty, the EU now has competence in the field of sport for the first time.
For these reasons, on 2 February 2010 these three countries signed the Agreement on the Protection and Sustainable Development of the Prespa Park Area, with the participation of the EU, which also requires the consent of the European Parliament.
Some countries move quicker than others and we see that with the countries of the former Soviet Union, who are now our valid colleagues here in the European Parliament.
The current drought demonstrates that the CAP urgently needs to include practical resources that will allow our farmers to deal with water shortages. I would therefore appeal for a subtle shift in the CAP to make it more relevant and able to guarantee our food self-sufficiency, the vitality of our agricultural sector and the preservation of our rural areas.
However, not enough attention has been given to them equally, as indicated by mid-term evaluations of its implementation.
Can I also welcome, Commissioner, this joint declaration made by you and the Indian Trade Minister, Anand Sharma, on 13 December 2010 stating unequivocally that nothing in the agreement would prevent the poorest from accessing life-saving medicines.
I think that the income generated from the charge on users of the infrastructure and from the charge based on external costs must be used to support the trans-European road network, improve road safety and provide safe parking areas, which are an absolute necessity for compliance with the applicable social legislation.
As Vice-Chair of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, I feel compelled to underline how important it is that we all cooperate, including outside the EU, to eliminate gender discrimination and gender violence so as to restore the social dignity of women and revive their active contribution to the local and supranational economy alike.
Otherwise, there must be consequences.
The report and work of the Committee on Legal Affairs make it quite clear that there are no reasons to believe that the Romanian authorities are acting against Mr Severin with the intent of persecution; notwithstanding that the position of the fake lobbying agency may generate doubts concerning the propriety of conduct on the part of information operators, the fact remains that the issue in question does not appear to fall into the category of cases in which immunity can legitimately be made to matter. I vote in favour of the request for waiver of immunity.
The inclusion of new indicators, and the establishment of lower and upper thresholds that will be symmetric when appropriate, will enable these indicators to serve as alert levels to avoid the current financial rescues being undertaken by the Commission and the International Monetary Fund.
If we look at the idea of ownership, which has been mentioned several times already, then it is certainly necessary for all of you to lend a hand.
Parliament notes that the Court of Auditors revealed errors and anomalies in the evaluation of one open procurement procedure which affected its quality.
The policy of development aid is neither an altruistic obligation, nor a means for former colonial powers of easing their consciences, where there has been colonisation.
It is vital for solutions to be found at last to problems that have hitherto remained unresolved. I am talking about the problems of citizenship, sharing debt and oil revenues and the difficult matter of undefined borders.
We also urgently need to ensure that Mauritania requires that third countries with which it establishes other agreements should respect the same rules followed by vessels flying the EU flag, so preventing competitive inequalities that put the EU fleet at a disadvantage.
In 1987, the Commission recommended that all acts that had up to 10 amendments be codified, so that Community legislation would be easier to understand.
It is also important that in order to develop the linguistic competence of deaf children, they must first learn their mother tongue sign language, which will allow them to become truly multilingual in the future.
For the first time, there is a new European supervisory framework with experience of the two previous tests, enabling the promotion of transparency, the promotion of reliability and, clearly, the promotion of effectiveness, which is the key aspect of these third tests.
We are calling for controls on reports by these agencies, for certain basic principles to be adopted, and for liability for compensation to be introduced for losses caused to states which were poorly evaluated or misleadingly evaluated. I also propose that basic accounting principles be introduced and applied in all the Member States of the European Union, so as to highlight the value, the official valuation of the property of these states, so that we have assets and liabilities and these states cannot be left prey to the whims of rating agencies and the parties they represent.
But, all right, this concession to France and Italy is fortunately merely symbolic. I am also pleased that, in its proposals, the Commission has shown that it, too, is aware that it does not have to look for solid solutions to a more efficient asylum and migration policy under church towers, and that this requires another, more European, form of cooperation.
The Europe 2020 strategy states that the key factors for smart growth are not only fostering knowledge, innovation, and education, and promoting the digital society, but also sustainable and inclusive growth.
Mr Cadec's report concerns the conclusion of the protocol setting out the fishing opportunities and the financial contribution provided for by the Fisheries Partnership Agreement between the European Community and the Republic of Seychelles. I supported this report because the assessment of the agreement shows that it helps to maintain the presence of EU fleets in the region while also serving to generate jobs in the local area; one of the reasons I wanted to support the agreement is that it makes a significant contribution to the stabilisation of the European canned tuna market.
As such, any recommendations in the report which concern simplification but do not require the financial regulations to be revised should still be included in the Seventh Framework Programme. I would like to congratulate the Commission on the measures which have already been implemented.
All I can say is that we have this dialogue with the EBA, we are determined - Mr Giegold has drawn all the lessons from this new round of tests, just as we drew lessons from the previous round, which was unsatisfactory - and we have an ambition - Mr Sanchez Presedo asked me to show ambition - which is to be demanding and rigorous when holding this dialogue, while respecting the powers and the independence of the EBA, just as we in the Commission demand respect for our own independence.
What we instead need is a debate on measures to enhance Frontex so as to provide maximum security at the external borders of the European Union - thereby ensuring freedom of movement - and a debate on speedy asylum proceedings and managed migration, on cooperation to deal with the causes of migration and on readmission agreements.
In the context of General Motors Belgium I believe that the conclusions that have been reached by the rapporteur are justified and have hence decided to vote in favour of this dossier.
The idea is impeccable but, in view of the North African crisis this year and the ongoing Libyan crisis, it is obviously not feasible.
They clearly fall under the powers of the Member States.
In parallel with putting the asylum system in place for the whole of Europe, which would also lead to greater burden-sharing - because if all Member States have a system that works, all Member States could receive asylum seekers - the solution for Greece is to continue with the reform plans that are being implemented under the action plan in Greece.
We have talked about cases of human rights violations, we have mentioned the names of opposition activists who have been put in prison and we have discussed how the ability of many civil and non-governmental organisations to operate is restricted.
There was a conference beforehand specifically called e-G8, attended by some of the big players in the Internet business and the authorities.
Here, too, the task is to achieve better coordination between the various funds, which is a general objective for the joint strategic framework.
All this will help to strengthen consumer confidence and overcome the reluctance of businesses to engage in cross-border trade.
The Commission is making fools of MEPs and the citizens they represent by proposing amounts in April and then dividing them by four two months later.
European trade policy measures in the textiles sector can be managed without imposing the excessive burden of presenting proof of origin for all imports.
This is certainly a step in the right direction but it is a minimalistic agreement that lacks teeth Indeed, Member States will only have the possibility, but in no way will they be obliged, of making heavy goods vehicles pay for the external costs they cause.
Investment in scientific research, vital infrastructure and the new green economy is crucial to long term growth and should never be cut back to meet short term EU targets.
We are therefore advocating a new system of evaluation for Schengen in order to be able to identify problems, respond accordingly, and make decisions if the problems persist.
The future agenda of cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation is strategically important in defining the objectives of every territorial reality in Europe, and the ways in which these can be achieved. 'Territorial cooperation' is an added value which paves the way towards realising all the possibilities of a region and increasing its competitiveness. I am voting in favour of the report because I believe it is important to define the objectives which guarantee the adequate allocation of funds for cooperative programmes, and to fully satisfy the needs of every area through the involvement of the most important regional projects.
It is of paramount importance that a minister assumes this responsibility and that these national management declarations have the signature of a political decision-maker on them.
Moreover, through rating actions, the collateral pool at the disposal of the Greek banks would most likely be wiped out.
Hence, I am calling for the de minimis aid threshold to be increased from EUR 30 000 to EUR 60 000 per firm.
On the other hand, we have laid down detailed rules for buying and selling online, in order to promote cross-border trade and to guarantee transparency for both businesses and consumers.
We must make more effort to implement three key priorities firstly, to promote entrepreneurship; secondly, to improve youth employability by adapting education to the needs of the labour market; and thirdly, to give young people an opportunity to play a more active role in society.
Moreover, in order to support their business, I invite the European Commission to implement the principle of reciprocity and to think of new ways of improving access by European companies to public procurement outside the Union, in order to ensure equal conditions for European and foreign companies who are competing for the allocation of public contracts.
That is all well and good. I would now like to ask you the following question what do you intend to do if the Council does not change its position Will you reject the package Will we have a second reading If so, then we are ready to fight this all the way with you.
Although I am not entirely in favour of the resources released in this way being allocated to the Union's budget, as I think that the Millennium Development Goals should benefit, at least in part, I wished to vote for paragraph 171 to send a positive signal to the Commission and the Council regarding the implementation of this tax.
Therefore I did not vote following the overall indications of my group, because I believe that we are facing such serious problems that we must at this point demonstrate the cohesion of European institutions and our ability to deal with the problems we are confronting.
The directive will authorise Member States to charge tolls on lorries not only for infrastructure costs, as is the case now, but also for noise and air pollution.
On the one hand, provision of mobile broadband networks across the board is a basic requirement that is in the interests of European citizens, but, on the other hand, development in the area of public and private broadcasting must be taken into consideration as an important instrument for cultural diversity and the provision of information.
The new fishing agreement between the European Union and the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe will be valid for a period of three years and will reinforce sustainable fishing outside Union waters while taking due account of environmental, social and economic factors.
If the EU adopts strict measures on the use of antibiotics with agricultural animals, we can also expect changes to legislation in third countries, particularly because of the financial losses that would be caused by a restriction on meat exports to Europe.
Finally, I would like to mention that we need to reduce our enterprises' administrative burden, in connection with reporting, for example.
I am pleased to be one of those signing this resolution, which reaffirms the importance of respect for democracy and human rights in relations between the European Union and Russia.
This would help our SMEs to draw the full benefits of the Single Market by allowing them to carry out their cross-border activities without requiring them to fulfil obligations which are often onerous and discouraging. I therefore call on the Council to give its opinion on this initiative quickly.
The Treaty of Lisbon gave the EU security and defence policy more opportunities.
Mr President, while debating how Greece can be rescued from a default that could cause an economic and financial storm around the world, this House is asking to increase its own budget for 2012 by almost 5.
The petitioners assert that the local threshold for carrying out an environmental impact assessment EIA, which was 20 hectares at the time, was not adhered to; that instead, the project was artificially subdivided into smaller parts and that in reality, the 20 hectare threshold was exceeded.
Those Member States that have asked for the revision of the Schengen system have also underlined that they were proposing this with the intention of preserving the free movement of our citizens, which is one of the cornerstones of the Union.
We should not forget that the effectiveness of the EAW in the fight against cross-border crime, organised crime and terrorism depends on the principle of mutual recognition between Member States, which is the basis for having a real European judicial area and also for the Schengen area to work properly.
In reaching my position, I see the adoption of its five-year multiannual plan as positive, although - as the Court of Auditors says - it should improve budgetary planning and management.
The transport policy of the Member States' transport ministers consists of demanding a sustainable and forward-looking transport policy for the European Union every Sunday while doing everything under the sun during the week to actively prevent such a policy from being realised.
We cannot allow the common agricultural policy CAP to have its budget cut, because that would mean that agriculture is probably worth less in Europe.
This report is thus intended to simplify and clarify EU law, which is spread over numerous pieces of legislation that have already been amended several times, making them difficult to understand.
The work is very often undeclared, and workers who come from rural areas or from abroad have low qualifications, do not know their rights, and become vulnerable individuals.
The measures put to the vote today seek to strengthen the instruments that are not working, and therefore it is essential that they are put into practice.
By the same token, I insist that my country, the Czech Republic, also has the right to determine for itself how it will produce electricity.
We co-decide on almost all major legislation in the EU, and that is a good thing, because we represent the people of the EU. We are the only body directly elected by them.
Consistency, credibility and strong, decisive, single-minded use of the budget as a fundamental instrument for fighting the crisis and compensating for Member States' consolidation policies - these are all issues that require a serious commitment on our part, that must truly ensure we once again play a crucial role in the security of the European Union, and above all - and this is my major concern - that invite us not to waste the opportunity of the trialogue.
the question for oral answer to the Commission on the enforcement of regulations on the shipping of toxic waste to developing countries from Mrs Bearder, Mrs Ek, Mr Ouzky, Mr Seeber, Mrs Kla and Mrs Harms on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, the European Conservatives and Reformists, the Group of the European People's Party Christian Democrats and the Group of the GreensEuropean Free Alliance - B7-02172011 and
And please, Commissioner Rehn, do not tell me that these policies I am denouncing are being pursued by socialist governments.
We need a solution that is unbureaucratic, fast, simple and political.
Mr President, once again, I deplore the persisting climate of fear and intimidation towards political opponents in Belarus and the ongoing harassment and persecution of opposition figures since the presidential elections in December 2010.
I think the primary concern can be summarised as the one underlying the impression that what is certainly a very large political majority, a two-thirds majority, but nonetheless a circumstantial political majority in the Hungarian Parliament, has succeeded in forcing a constitutional reform that places constraints on the achievement of political pluralism and, consequently, on the possibility of alternating between different political projects under the same set of rules of play. I think that is why it has caused concern, from the point of view of its concordance with the principles enshrined in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty on European Union and with the political dimension of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.
In this context, the request submitted by Canada to the World Trade Organisation WTO concerning the creation of a special dispute settlement body in relation to the European embargo is justified.
The international air agreements provided for under the Treaty of Lisbon are supranational agreements intended to overlap with the existing bilateral agreements implemented by the Member States.
When used in garments, for example as trimmings, such materials are currently not subject to mandatory labelling; most consumers are unaware of this and may not know the exact make-up of the textiles they buy.
I do not need any lessons from you in this regard. I do not defend Christians against Muslims. I defend all human beings who live on this planet, so that they can live free and equal - all of them
The agricultural sector still plays a strategic role today in our societies and economies.
This positive attitude must be verified in practice, especially with regard to the 27 non-tariff barriers identified by the European Union, which must be lowered so that we can open negotiations with Japan and make them one of the priorities of our trade policy.
It is true that a country in such a situation yearns for political unity, and it is not by playing petty political games, as is currently the case in Greece, that this situation will be resolved. I experienced this in Belgium for nine years, Mr Lange.
The highest nuclear safety standards should therefore be legally binding and global, facilities everywhere should be equally safe, and the International Atomic Energy Agency IAEA should be strengthened.
Further discussions relating to the previous procedure and implementation and its future administration, use and funding are required in this context.
Canada is making a great deal of money out of exploiting its tar sands but it also made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its CO2 emissions, and it has reneged on those commitments because of the financial benefits it is getting from tar sands.
On the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the European Commission announced that EUR 110 million would be allocated to stabilising the situation and protecting the environment around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.
Turkey is a privileged partner of the EU and, on the outside, declares a definite interest in becoming a full member of our European group. I therefore firmly believe that you should make full use of the potential that is already available to you through your role in solving this thorny issue, in which the EU is directly involved.
I think President Sarkozy's idea was an excellent one because the Internet is a global phenomenon.
We know that our actions can lead to widely differing results, even without our intending it, and can even have the opposite effect to the one we are seeking to achieve.
In Sri Lanka, the civilian population was bombed, among other atrocities.
The Commission wants to ensure a balanced, ambitious, high-quality agreement and it wants to be equally ambitious on sustainable development.
This is the purpose of the European border surveillance system EUROSUR, which has been progressively developed since 2008, and for which the Commission will present a legislative proposal during this year.
Therefore, we should ensure that the targets set at the Barcelona European Council of providing childcare to at least 90 of children between the age of three and the mandatory school age, and to at least 33 of children under the age of three, are met.
How has it been able to continue for so long I think that either the British Government should not be entitled to any rebate at all or that other countries which find themselves in a similar situation to that which Great Britain was in in 1984 should be treated the same. I hope that the Commission proposals will, in fact, move in this direction.
This broad provision for possible amendments leads me to express a negative opinion on amendments which would put limits on such future deliberations. I hope, however, that Council will join this agreement in short order and that there is also immediate and broad consensus in this House, a strong signal of the duty of transparency and also a call to action. I hope that the vote is nearly unanimous.
I call on the Commission to exert pressure to counter possible opposition on all these points; I am sure it can count on the support of Parliament in this.
Once the legislative proposals are on the table, Commissioner, we will then work intensively to achieve a good outcome together. I can already assure you that you are likely to have greater support here in Parliament than some other commissioners would have.
The other area of concern is around procurement.
Mr President, the public, the hardworking taxpayers across Europe who actually earn the money which so many in this place are so keen to spend, want Europe to do less and they want Europe to do it better.
It seems to me that it should be proportionally increased so that the entrepreneur's own contribution should not exceed 10 to 15 of the required amount currently, the amount required is 15 to 25 of the amount allocated for research. We should remember that one of the EU's main tasks is to eliminate social and geographical imbalances through the distribution of benefits deriving from innovation throughout the EU. We will not be able to achieve this goal if we neglect the new EU Member States in financial terms, thus supporting a further one-sided 'brain drain'.
We must therefore reorient our environmental policies to create much-needed convergence with our energy policies, leaving traditional sectoral approaches behind.
The first one, which is perhaps the most important for the Committee on Foreign Affairs and was also mentioned by the Commissioner, is the requirement not to decouple human rights conditionality, including respect for the basic standards of the right to work, from granting trade preferences. I believe that we have a difference of opinion on this point.
Let us get the information.
I have voted AGAINST granting the Director of the European Joint Undertaking for ITER and the Development of Fusion Energy discharge in respect of the implementation of the Joint Undertaking's budget for the 2009 financial year.
Moreover, we all know that internal controls can be sporadically useful but they are not part of a constructive approach to European integration, nor do they represent a cost-efficient long-term solution to monitoring movement and coping with immigration pressure.
Under this agreement, permanent access to the Parliament premises is allowed only to the registered interest representatives.
Dear colleagues, I believe that on the basis of the overwhelming majority of positive comments and evaluations in this Chamber today by Members of Parliament, as well as the evaluations of the Commission and of Council, warm congratulations are due to Bulgaria and Romania.
In Europe, close to two immigrant women out of three have low-skilled jobs, often in the sector of healthcare or domestic work.
I supported this resolution on the ILO convention on Decent Work for Domestic Workers.
All these incidents raise serious question marks with us, especially as we must not forget that Azerbaijan has signed up to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.
Mr President, I am coming back to you with some concrete next steps on the report on the role of culture in the EU's external actions that we talked about this morning. I want to start with a quote from a Hungarian diplomat in the United States, Mr Simonyi, who said that 'rock and roll, culturally speaking, was a decisive element in loosening up communist societies and bringing them closer to the world of freedom'. When we look, in particular, at today's uprisings of the young generation in North Africa and the Middle East, we can see that, today, an open Internet is that decisive element for moving into the world of freedom.
Would that help Greece or Europe I doubt it. Even such a severe haircut as 50 would not reduce the debt ratio below 100 of GDP, assuming that the international creditors, like the euro area Member States or the IMF, were excluded from this haircut.
Furthermore, it is also proving to be effective because it has given the Republic of Seychelles the necessary instruments to develop responsible fishing, increasing its stock management and fisheries monitoring capacity. I therefore believe it is right to proceed on the road of partnership agreements in this sector which is vital to the European economy.
They will be a credit to the Premier League, to Wales, and will give a much needed boost to the local economy, as fans, tourists and, hopefully, businesses come to the region.
Mr President, it is my belief that much progress has undeniably been made with the Commission's proposal, the Council's position and what is now on the table - which will be put to the vote tomorrow - if they are examined objectively.
Another commitment was to set up traceability systems for reproductive material originating from cloned animals outside the EU. These commitments were made on several occasions and must feature in the new proposals. I am confident that Member States will focus greater attention on the legitimate concerns of the European Union's citizens.
This would have given an incentive to rebuild the textile industry by demonstrating there was a market for their products.
When properly shaped in the budget, they could create room for much better and visibly better financing of what was under-financed - i.e. innovation, the management of migration flows, the external responsibilities of the European Union that are now so visible in the Mediterranean area, energy efficiency and, above all, how to connect Europe via the trans-European networks and the other cross-border connectors in energy systems.
Mr President, while unrest in the Middle East and North Africa requires the European Union to play a greater role in the Mediterranean region, I would like to raise the point of the second flotilla to Gaza.
The report sets some important objectives it targets ordinary people and workers through social innovation; it introduces measures to facilitate access to credit and finance for small and medium-sized enterprises; and, above all, it establishes an increasingly close and direct relationship linking together businesses, research centres and our universities.
I voted in favour of the report by Mr Manders.
We hope that cooperative measures can be coordinated at all levels of governance, in conjunction with a Europe 2020 strategy which meets the demands of territories and with the other existing territorial strategies.
We must also remember that large cuts will not benefit the most vulnerable Member States, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, but, on the contrary, will reduce the EU's ability to support them.
The credibility of the EU is at stake.
This report contains a number of positive proposals, in particular, regarding the participation of young people in the process of drafting European youth policies, the enhancement of informal and non-formal education, and an improvement to trainees' status.
Commissioner, I still think you can do more for simplification.
In relation to my report, Baroness Ashton, I would particularly like you to take note of paragraph 6, which calls for the drafting of a White Paper with a strategic focus on the European Union's role in international organisations through to 2020.
In my country's constitution, there is no mention of this issue, and so when will the European Parliament be holding a debate on the Italian constitution Moreover, it is rather strange because, in my country, the only party that wants to change the constitution is Mr Berlusconi's centre-right party.
The EU must enhance its strategy for combating the factors causing deterioration of the forests, such as uncontrolled deforestation, fires and air pollution.
Indeed, I want to ask Mr Piebalgs in his reply to explain what the EU is doing to combat continuing and deteriorating human rights violations, in particular, concerning human rights defenders such as Hawa Abdulla from the AU-UN peace-keeping mission, who has been subject to arbitrary detention and beaten.
Apart from the specific measures intended to address this particular situation, the Council remains fully committed to the further development of the common European asylum system.
In view of this change, the Committee on Transport and Tourism has decided to draft an own-initiative report with the aim of setting out some general principles regarding how air agreements should be evaluated by Parliament in terms of substance, rather than being confronted with the final decision and merely being able to adopt or reject it. Parliament's new powers, provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon, bring with them new responsibilities to ensure that Parliament and its competent committee are well informed about the preparation of the agreements to which it will subsequently be asked to give its consent.
Promoting labour standards through the EU's negotiations with third party countries benefits both the Member States and the third party countries.
This year, together with the vast majority of Members of the European Parliament, I refused to grant the Council of Ministers discharge in respect of its activity in the 2009 financial year.
Thirdly, the Stability and Growth Pact should include automatic sanctions against those who break the terms of euro membership, as we should never again allow ourselves to slide into this misery.
Enough talking, now let us move on.
It should introduce the financial tax and Eurobonds. I therefore voted for the Feio and Wortmann-Kool reports while I abstained on the Ferreira, Ford and Haglund reports and I voted for the Goulard report for Eurobonds. A choice of votes that is intended to reflect my very mixed feelings over this package, which admittedly does offer some steps forward but which is still too poorly balanced Europe will be unable to continue to develop without its people and therefore we must debate solutions for the future in public.
Azerbaijan and other countries in the region need to get a clear signal that violations of human and civil rights cannot be tolerated under any circumstances.
We have big military potential, largely untapped, so decisions to use military assets and to support each other in pooling and sharing are something that we need to take forward.
The question of the planning and management of European Union operations remains an open one.
We should not care whether a farm is large or small; instead we should be concerned with whether it is run in an economically sound manner.
To this end, the solidarity mechanims must be strengthened in terms of redistribution of asylum seekers, organised mobility and new partnerships with third countries.
Directive 76432EEC is one of the separate directives of the EC type-approval system provided for in Council Directive 74150EEC, as replaced by Directive 200337EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units, and repealing Directive 74150EEC, and lays down technical prescriptions concerning braking devices.
As I understand, the report contains a legislative resolution on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to units of measurement.
As regards immigration, I have heard Italy criticised for not wanting to accept any refugees. A few hours ago, however, Mrs Malmstrom issued a public statement saying that when the tragedy of the Libyan exodus began everyone undertook to receive at least 800 refugees per country.
The support given to Israel's policies of aggression and occupation and to the policy of non-compliance with United Nations resolutions, as practised by Israel and other countries like Morocco, are other factors that we also denounce here.
This report on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation EC No 146697 on the strengthening of the surveillance of budgetary positions and the surveillance and coordination of economic policies is part of an EU economic governance package.
Many honest citizens have lost a lot of money because of the Commission's blameworthy laxity in this case.
However, it is extremely important that, when we talk about agriculture and the future of the CAP, 'simplification' and 'innovation' are the watchwords.
However, in my opinion, this Commission document lacks analysis of research and data on children's education, care and social protection, taking into account information from all 27 European Union Member States.
The EU's alliance with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NATO and the United States to undertake wars and carry out acts of aggression in countries like Libya is proof of this.
Special emphasis must be put on preventing youth unemployment, for which it is necessary to harmonise training supply with labour-market demand, provide middle-term national and regional forecasts on expected labour demand and enable national education systems to be more effective in guaranteeing the attainment of those skills that are actively sought on the labour market.
Frontex is also supporting the Italian authorities in second-line border control activities by the briefing and screening of migrants.
The current directive only covers spent fuel storage facilities directly related to nuclear installations, the current proposal intends to assure safety in the long term of the management of existing and future radioactive waste.
The main idea in the report is that we in the EU are now going through an economic crisis.
I welcome the agreement which has been reached with the Council at second reading. I believe that this is an agreement which, although it can be improved, will boost the competitiveness of the textile industry, while at the same time providing consumers with better information.
For the sake of fairness, we should also provide appropriate support to regions that do not qualify for Objective 1 but are nonetheless faced with structural difficulties. I am therefore glad that the European Commission has proposed creating an intermediate category for regions where GDP per capita is between 75 and 90 of the EU average. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Hahn for this work.
I voted in favour of this resolution on guaranteeing independent impact assessments. I agree with the rapporteur that impact assessments IAs are a key instrument in the legislative process, and one which European legislators should make greater use of in future. IAs show legislators the possible consequences of their policy options and help them make a decision. IAs can thus make a significant contribution to better law making.
The first clarification which needs to be made, because a remark was made about this in the Chamber, is that, faced with such a crisis, agricultural policy is not the problem but rather the solution.
We all know that at some point, there will be a restructuring of the debt, for instance in Greece, for the simple reason that the Greek Government needs to be given the chance to regain confidence and that Greek society needs to be restructured.
The umbrella organisation of IHH, Union of Good, supports the activity of extremist radicals through selling weapons to them. I ask fellow MEPs to refrain from exploiting the Middle East crisis for their own political goals, which do not have anything to do with the peace process and from a biased attitude which very much sounds like the language and mechanism of the Communist and Soviet attitude towards Israel.
I would particularly like to emphasise our position on the export of radioactive waste. I dare say that not a single member of the Committee is a nimby 'not in my backyard'. We are not in favour of irresponsible management and we want radioactive waste to be disposed of safely.
Russia is just as dependent on the European Union, because they sell most of their products to us. If we do not buy their energy products, then the Russian economy will encounter serious stability problems in the future.
Speaking of Estonia, I think that this directive will bring to an end the situation in which our lorries pay in other countries, while vehicles from other countries do not pay to drive on our roads. I hope that the government will put an end to this type of unequal treatment and set equal conditions for all.
We could almost say that no one has noticed this.
In particular, the introduction of a financial transaction tax is an issue that we must finally take in hand.
Leaving aside what you said earlier, Baroness Ashton, what further steps will the European Union take to recognise the Palestinian State and champion this idea before the United Nations
Education is about our future, it is about having adults who are employable, who are fit, who are healthy, who are not a drain on our social services.
Cooperating in order to improve vocational education and training means reducing the youth unemployment rate, equipping workers with cognitive tools and providing greater and simplified funding opportunities.
The world economy, including Europe, has experienced the worst crisis since the Great Depression and we have had to draw the necessary conclusions.
Cultural and creative industries are not only a source of wealth and employment but also contribute to Europe's social and cultural fabric.
This is why the European Commission must urge during the negotiations for some legally binding clauses to be introduced relating to these areas.
In order to enable the deployment of these industries, it is equally essential to improve access to funding for professionals in this sector to introduce microfinancing, develop patronage and publicprivate partnerships, consider introducing new, innovative funding instruments, and train professionals in the banking sector in the specific characteristics of these industries.
Mr President, a strong, well-funded cohesion policy is vital if the EU is to play its part in creating jobs and growth, particularly when Member States are cutting their spending.
Commissioner, you have just said it yourself this is a sector with a major potential for our economy and employment, which is why we must take specific, stimulating measures, such as reducing the tax on online projects, because the current system, certainly the VAT rate, is out of step with the times and is absolutely unfair.
The European Commission and the Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship intend to carry on supporting industrial policy and small and medium-sized enterprises, partly so as to provide answers to our citizens on the issue of the quality of the products made by our businesses.
At a time when transactions involving assets and capital are becoming increasingly globalised, it is important that the European Union adopt a common investment policy in line with the strategy set out by all the Member States.
For this very reason, we are very happy in the Union and want to help it become progressively stronger.
It cannot be. For a start, it has to be a case of applying resources to resettling refugees.
The EU has set itself the objective of not only becoming a pole of excellence on corporate social responsibility CSR but also of promoting CSR in its external policies.
It therefore urgently needs to be integrated with the EU budget to enable increased democratic control, accountability and transparency of financing.
In the context of the current crisis that the European Union is going through, the recently introduced cohesion policy is one of the effective ways to kick-start the EU's economy.
At this point, I would like to thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to prepare this report and I would also like to thank the European Commission, which has prepared this report and which has included the problems faced by young people amongst the fundamental priorities of the EU's 10-year development plan.
The banks will also be tested on the basis of an upper capital threshold, core tier one.
This proposal was tabled by the Commission at the express request of the European Council in the immediate aftermath of the floods that hit Pakistan in the summer of last year and brought widespread devastation to the country and to its people.
Ms Koppa also asked whether the Commission will propose a revision of the principle of exclusive responsibility of the state of first illegal entry. I would like to underline that this is a principle according to which a person found irregularly on the territory of a Member State is returned to the state of first entry into the EU. It is a specific rule under the Dublin Regulation, which establishes that the Member States have to assess which Member State is responsible for examining an asylum application lodged on their territory.
It points to an incredibly important issue which has not often been discussed to date, namely, the need for national authorities to take action, in cooperation with the European Commission, to prevent unemployment by tailoring vocational training to the needs of the job market.
They seem to be based on the idea that these states can deal with the difficult situation themselves, and that they are capable of improving their situation by themselves through a 'disciplined' approach.
We are, and will continue to be, here to support and encourage it, certain that only through such struggle can change be instigated, and an alternative that is needed increasingly urgently put in place in Europe.
The conclusions adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 11 and 12 April 2011 and the communication issued by the Commission last week are important steps in this direction.
Procedures must be improved, but I would also like to take this opportunity to call on all the Members of the European Parliament to understand that a certain level of discipline is required of us. I know that they are sometimes a burden, but if we want a Parliament which is both safe and open to the public, we must carry out checks, although I know that Members and I myself are sometimes irritated by them.
I agree with extending the scope of the proposal for a regulation on the professional cross-border transport of euro cash by road between euro area Member States to the territory of Member States that are about to introduce the euro.
This kind of action is totally unacceptable.
It comprises 28 key actions and concrete measures to increase the education and training of young people through mobility and ease their transition from education into the labour market.
Unfortunately, money does not grow on trees and the days of easy solutions and painless choices are now behind us. That is why the PPE Group is calling for sustainable public finances and for 5 or 6 budget deficits not to be permitted. A debt burden - the painful evidence of which we are witnessing - stands in the way of economic growth, not only in our European countries, but also in the United States.
The abolition of internal border control is particularly important for the entire European Union and each Member State individually.
However, if we want to be safe, identical criteria should be applied to facilities already existing or planned in the EU's neighbourhood Russia, Belarus, Turkey, Armenia, Switzerland and Ukraine. As we consistently strive for this, we must speak with one voice.
Viewed from this angle, too, she is an outstanding candidate. I hope that, with this backing, we are able to give you a little extra push to put forward Mrs Lagarde's case as the next occupant of the role of Managing Director of the IMF.
Environmental protection is one of the European Union's priorities.
It mentions, specifically in the recitals, important issues like the decline of public investment in higher education, the increase in fees and the consequent widening social gap, but this issue is not properly taken up in the body of the resolution.
In view of the Court of Auditors' statement that it has obtained reasonable assurances that the annual accounts for the financial year 2009 are reliable, and that the underlying transactions are legal and regular, I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the implementation of the budget of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the financial year 2009.
The Treaty of Lisbon has given the Union a voice through the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyVice-President of the Commission.
In a short while we will be voting on the package on economic governance, which sets out responsible measures in order to adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact, clean up public finances and allow growth to pick up. Cohesion policy is the second pillar on which this growth must rely, a sustainable, intelligent and inclusive growth.
In other words, culture is seen as a sort of vanguard for advancing and communicating the interests of the European Union and the Member States, and promoting international trade.
If it turned out that they had not been achieved, we would then have the possibility of together examining the causes of non-compliance and whether it was due to domestic or external factors.
We were thus unable to reach a compromise on this issue.
I believe that a voluntary register is simply a sham and will not offer greater transparency or bring us to a point where the Council of Ministers will be prepared to get involved, so we do not even have all the key legislative bodies on board.
The purpose of this proposal is to undertake a codification of Council Directive 86415EEC of 24 July 1986 on the installation, location, operation and identification of the controls of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors. I voted 'in favour'.
The directive, which spells the end of a lengthy debate between Parliament and the Council, provides, among other things, for the period in which consumers can withdraw from a sale to be doubled from seven to fourteen days, and for enhanced protection in the event of a lack of conformity.
The European Fisheries Fund EFF needs to effectively and substantially support the renewal and modernisation of fishing fleets, not least by making the different types of fishing more selective, and by replacing engines for reasons of safety, of environmental protection and of fuel efficiency.
Food security at EU and global level and globalisation necessitate a new and strong common agricultural policy, which will firstly improve our competitiveness on the international market, secondly ensure a fair income for farmers, thirdly ensure that consumers can buy high-quality products at fair prices, fourthly ensure the sustainable development of rural areas and fifthly help to improve the state of the environment.
The European Union should take inspiration from the model followed in the World Trade Organisation WTO. For more consistent and better-integrated cooperation, it should have observer status in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation NATO, be more closely coordinated with the Council of Europe, and participate fully in the activities of the G7G8 and G20.
One of the strategy's major lines of action aims to guarantee Internet access throughout Europe by 2013 and high-speed broadband coverage of at least 30 Mbps by 2020.
This report, which I voted for, calls for closer involvement of Parliament's committees and a detailed explanation when the Commission refrains from issuing an IA. Finally, it challenges Parliament's committees to increase the use of IAs so as to improve the quality of its law making.
I am convinced that the sustainable management of forests is essential if we are to maintain the capacity of the Union's forests to fulfil their economic, ecological and social functions.
The report was already adopted unanimously by the ITRE Committee, takes on board the recommendations of the expert group and identifies further scope for improvement of the various EU research instruments.
Awarding the city the title of European Capital of Culture at this juncture would not only help in the cultural regeneration of the city and in improving the city's image in other countries, but would also help to commemorate important aspects of European history and identity.
Commissioner, I am, of course, very glad to hear you stress again the importance that you attach to the maintenance of the Schengen area. I know you are very sincere on that, but my worry is that, despite that, people seem to have got the wrong end of the stick and the impression has got abroad - for instance, last week an article in the Financial Times said that 'Schengen as well as the eurozone was disintegrating' - that somehow the Commission is fairly relaxed about the reintroduction of internal border controls.
Even though there might not be full agreement on every detail, it is important to note that there exists a core common understanding on the big ticketed items, notably, the need for a comprehensive strategy to boost research and innovation in the context of the Europe 2020 strategy, the need to make the programme more accessible to the wide range of possible contributors throughout Europe, and the need to further simplify procedures to allow all participants to focus on creativity rather than bureaucracy.
In order to resume economic growth, we need an alternative model to the one proposed in the package, which is based on strategic investments and creating new jobs.
This is why we have set out measures to strengthen further the mobility opportunities available to young people and it is why my Commission colleague Laszlo Andor and I have placed so much emphasis on improving conditions for young people moving into the labour market.
The key objective of the 'Youth on the Move' initiative must be to increase European cohesion.
The EU and the Member States should increase their efforts to encourage youth employment and reduce their unemployment rate, in particular, through improving the match between the training systems and the needs of the labour market.
The authorities, whether European, national or regional, by accepting the mobilisation of public money to mitigate the closing of a plant, which achieves nothing except market redundancies, are surrendering their powers.
Most importantly, you can no longer be seen to be on the side of German industry and all the power companies whose names begin with E - EDF, E.ON and EnBW - in this discussion.
We believe that improving these relations can help make Europe more competitive, since Japan accounts for 9 of world GDP, or over 35 when its GDP is added to our own.
This is the framework, of course, that was already outlined during the referendum process It is important that this continues, so as to ensure that the political will of both states and of the international community is put into practice in the form of genuine development projects for citizens of both countries.
Because the Council is not able to address the current imbalance in our society and to give Parliament the opportunity of making the ministers from the Member States directly accountable to us, the results of the trialogue are being weakened.
The Union budget is a tool for global and integrated development at a time when the Member States alone cannot ...
But the bottom line is - and nobody referred to it other than the Commissioner - that there is a EUR 20 billion benefit to both economies here if we can work out a free trade agreement.
Yet these doctors and nurses had simply treated injured protestors who were brought to their hospitals.
In its June 2006 conclusions, the European Council called on the EU and its Member States to extend the national accounts to key aspects of sustainable development.
They are told there is no alternative to this; it is a form of sado-monetarism, and it is sending them crazy.
The Schengen Agreement was concluded on 14 June 1985.
Let me also add that last year, an agreement was reached at the G20 summit in Seoul in Korea to reduce European representation in relative terms on the IMF Board by two seats, so as to increase the voice and representation of emerging market economies.
This entire context of pressure exerted on these countries, as well as the objectives of this pressure, are the reason for our abstention.
This includes ensuring that the forests play a permanent and growing role in combating climate change and safeguarding the economic basis of the forestry and timber industries, so that we have an adequate future supply of wood.
We are currently completing an impact assessment of the various possible approaches to resolving the problem that I just mentioned, including national inspection and mandatory national risk assessment plans and programmes, as well as more targeted training for national officials responsible for enforcing the provisions and, on the other side of the coin, for proving that those who declare waste to be second-hand goods are doing so fraudulently.
The second issue is that the facts involved are vitally important and the consequences are very serious for our countries and our peoples, not least bearing in mind the situations that are now being experienced here in the European Union, for instance in Greece and Ireland and, as is being announced, Portugal.
Ensuring access to suitable education and appropriate courses is absolutely essential in order to make sure that people finishing school, university or vocational training have no trouble in finding employment in their chosen field.
The proposal lays down requirements to ensure that Member States establish a national regulatory and organisational framework, in order to be able to draw up appropriate national programmes for spent fuel and radioactive waste management, from their generation to their disposal.
We need to place greater emphasis on monitoring of EU expenditure and on a critical assessment of current policies in this field.
We must therefore start to monitor the use of modern chemicals and pharmaceuticals in agriculture very closely and, in the interests of protecting the health of our citizens, also assess very purposefully, systematically and permanently the consequences of using these substances.
We believe that all this is certainly able to facilitate, in an initial phase, an exchange of arguments between the committees concerned and that, in cases of major importance, it can also be useful in 'preparing the ground' for votes in plenary.
The German Free Democratic Party delegation in the European Parliament assumes that the inclusion of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area will further improve freedom of movement within the EU. Now that both Member States have achieved positive evaluation results in all areas of the Schengen review, there should be no more obstacles to delay inclusion further.
From the perspective of the cost-benefit factor, this form of company could, in future, be more important than the European company. I am thinking in this respect of subsidiaries and transfers of registered offices throughout Europe.
The first point is simplification - less bureaucracy - and we stated that when we started the Seventh Framework Programme.
I would like to highlight Article 23 in the report about stamping out illegal logging. I should mention that implementing sustainable forest management is vital to preserving biodiversity in Europe.
It is therefore based on mutual trust of the systems in force, whether in the EU or in Canada, and provides for obligations and methods of cooperation so that the importing authority can issue its own certificate on the aeronautical product, part or appliance without duplicating all the assessments done by the exporting authority.
We are also aware that there is a double standard protecting the economic interests of European arms manufacturers, which have made millions by selling arms to dictators who have subsequently used them to massacre their own people and those of neighbouring states.
I would like to thank you very much for your constructive support today. I am sure that in a few years we will be discussing this subject again in Parliament with the aim of extending and improving this first directive.
Accelerated growth in Central Europe also makes a significant contribution to growth throughout Europe and improves investment conditions, yielding profits not only in Warsaw and Prague, but also in Amsterdam, London and Berlin.
The European Union produces more that 40 000 m3 of radioactive waste each year, 80 is short-lived low-level radioactive waste and about 5 is long-lived low-level radioactive waste.
They should publish the names of people with whom they have had official meetings in the course of their work.
The under 30s account for 20 of the European population, but unemployment of the under 24s has now reached nearly 21, and almost 15 of 18-24s leave further or higher education before the end of the second cycle and do not follow any additional study or training.
During this process, I have not disguised my own scepticism regarding the introduction of origin labelling. I am therefore also pleased that we agreed on a text that merely requires the Commission to analyse the need for origin labelling.
On Sunday, 5 June, the German authorities notified the European Commission that, based on the epidemiological investigations, they believe bean sprouts are the possible source of the E coli outbreak affecting mainly the northern part of Germany.
We must discuss European added value and the necessary synergies between the national budgets and the EU budget in greater detail than before because, irrespective of the potential savings to be achieved in the EU budget, a lot of the additional resources required can be discussed in the context of a genuine debate on synergy and potential savings between the EU budget and the national budgets.
Europe definitely needs rules and a legal framework for establishing mandatory requirements for ensuring the highest possible level of safety, which both we and Europe's citizens want so much.
It is not the only one, as is also highlighted in the OECD-FAO report 'Agricultural Outlook 2011-2020'.
Another idea that has mileage in it is to gradually abandon subsidies that are harmful to the environment, along the lines of what the Commission has done for tobacco. I am also pleased that the European Parliament has reaffirmed its support for own resources because it is only right that the Union should manage its own budget.
Consumer protection being a complex issue, an approach reflecting all of the above was needed from the outset.
Forests are the main repository of carbon and have a vital role to play in the fight against climate change.
The new Multiannual Financial Framework of the European Union must be established at Community level and national development programmes should be adjusted to each other in a way that they result in an optimal implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy by creating the necessary synergies.
Before we proceed to the vote on the report, I would like to underline that the ongoing activities of the working group on the code of conduct for MEPs and outside interests do not intend to put into question the substance of the agreement reached with the Commission and the content of the Casini report.
This is my 12th discharge exercise. I believe this must be the first time that we have worked together in such a constructive spirit; not only Commissioner Semeta, but also individual commissioners in charge of their own remits have really invested time on this discharge.
In his discharge report Mr Rivellini proposes that the European Parliament should grant discharge to the European Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Auditors, the European Ombudsman, and the European Data Protection Supervisor and their respective offices.
However, we hope that they will be taken seriously if we want the Innovation Union programme to be one of the successes of the Europe 2020 strategy.
Mr Dess's report also supports my proposal for greater flexibility in the second pillar.
Inclusion could strengthen the environmental integrity of our climate commitments, ensuring that all emissions and removals are covered, while enhancing the visibility of efforts by farmers and foresters to increase sinks through sustainable land-use management.
Madam President, Commissioner, honourable Members, today's debate is a good occasion for me to present the Presidency's observations on the recently held conciliation on the proposal for a regulation on novel foods.
Mr President, in recent years, academic and political focus on culture and education has increased dramatically, with analysis consistently highlighting these areas to be crucial not only in encouraging economic growth and social cohesion, but also in facilitating mobility for young people across Europe.
Mr President, I do not know if we are about to vote on the resolution, but we will eventually do so after the end of this debate. I think this issue is a good example of what it means to be consistent with our own principles and values, because this Parliament has spoken out on several occasions against the death penalty, wherever it may occur.
The new food epidemic illustrates that the EU neither can nor will protect human life and public health because, as a transnational union of monopolies, it has promised to serve and protect the profits of capital, not the lives of the workers.
At a time when the future common fisheries policy appears to be taking shape, I believe that our fishermen are not resistant to change; quite the contrary.
It lays down the maximum emission level on the basis of engine power and provides for the gradual, phased reduction of emissions.
These are Nea Dimokratia proposals, which the government has been unable to implement for 18 months now.
This fact, combined with climate change, provides sufficient grounds for mobilising all EU Member States and making equal, consistent efforts to manage the Union's forests.
In order to respond to the challenges ahead, we support the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, a strategy that should help Europe recover from the crisis and come out stronger, through job creation and smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.
The democratic opposition parties requested legal guarantees that the new constitution would be based on broad public consensus, and in the absence of this, they withdrew from the constitutional process.
The audits carried out showed that the accounts of the Joint Undertaking were reliable and that the underlying transactions were legal and regular. I do however think it would be helpful if the Joint Undertaking heeded the call for it to improve its documentation of IT processes and activities and the mapping of IT risks, and also to develop a business continuity plan and a data protection policy.
This money is to be reinvested in transport infrastructure of any kind, while a minimum of 15 of the revenues are to be earmarked for TEN-T projects. I think we also need long-term measures which will bring about convergence in the methods which all charging systems of the Member States use to calculate external costs.
Mr President, just when responsible people and governments are watching every penny, the Commission proposes more expense - Youth on the Move card, European skills passport, European Vacancy Monitor - through Europe 2020, all for cultural diplomacy and to get young people to travel when they do that already, backpacking their way round the world on their own initiative.
The Commission is now proposing an exceptional response as a sign to the Greek people that there is hope.
Some time after that, the alleged legal department of the company sent out letters, which I have here, asking my fellow countryman to pay EUR 3 529.38, which apparently included interest and the company's legal costs.
One thing is clear as we have said, restructuring is not an alternative to the painful fiscal consolidation efforts that all the Member States have to make if they want to correct their imbalances in terms of deficit and debt.
It is quite clear that Lady Ashton is more gifted at issuing moralising press releases and playing Lady Bountiful than she is cut out for dealing with the diplomatic issues that you want her to tackle on behalf of the 27 Member States.
The mobility of European citizens within the Union, the freedom to travel, is one of the key European freedoms, and any restriction would undermine one of the most tangible benefits our citizens have obtained from closer European integration.
On 1 October 2009, the aggregated results were sent to the Ecofin Council, which, on 2 December that year, asked the CEBS to provide it with information on the strength of the banking system, for which new stress tests would be carried out.
These include, in particular, plans for a European student lending facility, the European Youth Guarantee, to ensure that young people are in either training or employment within four months of leaving school, and the recently announced Youth at Work plan, designed to build contacts between young people and businesses.
How and to what extent should ITER be financed The subject has now become a recurrent item on the agenda of the European Parliament.
First of all, an explicit reminder of the added value of European territorial cooperation and of its potential for increased competitiveness. A proposal to increase its funding to 7 of the next budget for cohesion policy.
So-called 'security' issues should also be noted, including 'the establishment of the missile defence shield'. We must remember that Romania, a member of the EU and NATO, has expressed willingness to host this system, which constitutes a threat to Russian security and to peace in Europe.
As far as excise duties are concerned, the harmonisation of structures must, in particular, result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of charging the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the Member States' national markets.
We need to think hard about qualifications, and qualifications which can be transferred and recognised across the EU. We also need to look at access, so that all of those who need early years education services can get hold of them.
The different legal regimes covering the protection of consumer rights, which still remain, reduce consumer confidence in the single market and do not encourage companies to expand their business in other Member States.
Much of what needs to happen in rural areas should also be covered by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the purpose of which is not just to support farmers, but also to support rural areas.
I voted for this report because I agree that the Council should be able, after debating a Commission recommendation, to impose a fine on any Member State that distorts, whether intentionally or through grave negligence, figures relating to the deficit and public debt relevant to the application of Articles 121 and 126 of the Treaty, and to the Protocol No 12 annexed to the Treaty. I also agree that the aforementioned fines should act as an effective deterrent and should be proportional to the nature, seriousness and duration of the offence. I agree that it should not be possible for the fine to exceed 0.2 of gross domestic product.
That is why we need to establish a genuine 28th system, by which I mean an additional, autonomous European protection mechanism to go alongside those available in the national courts.
There are three points that I want to make.
Instead of criticising the flotilla, the EU should condemn the threats of violence made against us by the Israel Defence Forces.
With this regulation, we have established an important basis for statistical information about the interplay between the economy and the environment, which we hope to expand with further modules in the future as included in the report and the draft resolution.
Satellite navigation systems should ensure interoperability between different systems and should also allow intermodal use in passenger and freight transport services.
Member States, companies and the general public are continually having to think about how they can make savings and how they can manage from one day to the next.
Mr Barroso, do you accept that the finances of the European Central Bank and its integrity are now in a serious and parlous state
I welcome SD amendments to this report at committee stage representing greater transparency in the legislative process and promoting greater ease of access for SMEs and NGOs through the publication of road maps and an extended consultation period.
The European Council will be invited to endorse the country-specific recommendations approved by the Council, which should be reflected by all Member States in their national decisions as regards their budgets and structural reforms.
on behalf of the ALDE Group.
Do the state of the public finances of our Member States, our growth prospects and Europe's place in the world match the vision of the founding fathers of Europe Definitely not they have evolved and changed.
I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament has managed to initiate specific legislative measures, such as greater cooperation over the introduction of a European patent. I also consider the area of standardisation very important in relation to the introduction of innovations into practice, as well as their application by small and medium-sized enterprises.
In this context, I support the proposal of the Committee of the Regions to create a 'virtual network of creativity' which would be open to all businesses, local and regional bodies, the private sector and citizens and would provide advice, support and access to venture capital and technical services. I would also like to draw attention to the current lack of improved and proactive interactions between universities and businesses, and I would like to call on the Commission to launch a new Europe-wide programme for professional training and education for senior staff at universities, and officials dealing with technology.
The interests of economic and financial groups are prioritised, pressuring Russia to join the World Trade Organisation in order to promote 'a level playing field for business communities on both sides and liberalise trade in the global economy', with Russia having to facilitate foreign investment and renounce any 'protectionist measures'.
How the accountability of members of boards of directors is organised must be clearly defined, and must be put into practice in a reasonable way, so as not to jeopardise financial institutions' willingness to seize business opportunities, which is a desirable aspect of their work, or the quality of the human resources at their disposal.
In spite of the advantages to be gained from signing the agreement, we should, however, bear in mind issues where both parties to the agreement present opposing views.
Mr Zver's report draws attention to numerous barriers that act as disincentives to mobility in Europe, and I would like to highlight some of them.
What happened on 8 April is deplorable and has, and had, my strongest condemnation. I have been adamant that we need a strong united EU response. I have written to the Foreign Minister of Iraq and I spoke to him again yesterday.
Coordination within the European Parliament is key, as is coordination with the European Commission and the newly established External Action Service.
This could be easier to achieve with only one tax, but it is also feasible to build the revenue on a group of taxes that meet criteria on transparency, equity, visibility, efficiency and sufficient harmonisation.
Not all the grand ambitions for the Consumer Rights Directive have been achieved, but I believe an important step has been taken that does not compromise the market's normal workings.
Regarding point 27 of the report, this point again makes a very precise reference to a real problem. A leading university lecturer recently shared his view with me that, in actual fact, Bulgarian universities are not aware that there is also an Erasmus programme for teachers.
Another boost will come following the wonderful achievement of Swansea City Football Club - and I say this for the benefit of my colleague Richard Howitt - who have just deservedly reached the Premier Football League after a fantastic season. I pay tribute to the manager, players, directors, staff and fans who have made promotion possible.
Furthermore, agriculture needs support in order to innovate and focus effort on a more efficient use of energy, water and soil.
In this vein, Parliament's request for the Commission to consider creating an independent European agency that could also be responsible for sovereign debt ratings is significant.
In general the management of migratory flows in the EU and in individual Member States requires the effective management of borders.
Our resolution rightfully raises the issue of the charges against the leaders of the political opposition, charges that look ever more selective in nature, and insists on a guarantee of the transparency of the investigations and of the judicial process.
Congratulations once again, Mr Coelho, and congratulations to Romania and Bulgaria.
We need the support of Parliament to shape a decent budget for the next year consolidation on the one hand and contribution to growth and jobs on the other. I hope that this year the procedure will be smoother and less nervous than the procedure for the 2011 budget.
Moreover, you cannot ignore the role of Goldman Sachs in the current speculation on sovereign debt, any more than its responsibilities in the economic and financial crisis, and the investigations it is undergoing in the United States.
It is very good that the new directive will supersede the various acts incorporated in it; this proposal fully preserves the content of the acts being codified and hence does no more than bring them together with only such formal amendments as are required by the codification exercise itself. I voted 'in favour'.
Furthermore, in the event of commercial disputes, the reciprocity principle should be applied, the protection of intellectual property rights should be improved and there should be reciprocal access to the services and public procurement markets.
We must stress that respect for these principles is vital to promoting cooperation between the EU and Ukraine, including with a view to signing the Association Agreement.
Prime Minister Essebsi's speech on television may help as the country moves towards elections on 24 July, but he acknowledged the problems of a country where economic growth rates are down to between 0 and 1. We have to ensure support to Tunisia, to its economy and its civil society, and that means thinking not just of the long term, not just of the importance of a new strategy, but of what we do now and how we support countries - Egypt, Tunisia and others - right now with the budgetary problems that they have.
Hungary, which was the first country in the world to be the subject of a coordinated action to resettle its refugees in 1956, has very particular responsibilities - historical responsibilities - to act on this refugee crisis as well.
The institutions set up under the agreements reached at interparliamentary and intergovernmental level are intended to achieve these ends; these are the right place to demand explanations for possible infringements of rights and effectively encourage good behaviour and democratic reforms.
If this project is to be truly effective, action must be taken on two fronts.
I therefore support the creation of new instruments and increased funding for measures designed to protect the EU's forests, particularly in order to address the new challenges brought about by climate change.
The Consultative Working Party with authority on this issue has considered the proposal for a Council directive codifying Council Directive 9279EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on cigarettes, Council Directive 9280EEC of 19 October 1992 on the approximation of taxes on manufactured tobacco other than cigarettes, and Council Directive 9559EC of 27 November 1995 on taxes other than turnover taxes which affect the consumption of manufactured tobacco.
Earlier this week I warned colleagues that heading into a direct confrontation between Parliament and the Council on an issue that I did not believe I could explain to any man on the street would not be a responsible position of this Parliament.
Madam President, can I start by congratulating the Vice-PresidentHigh Representative on her personal success in negotiating the compromise in the United Nations on EU speaking rights, where others had failed.
Here we have young people - who organised themselves via social networks like Facebook - arrested and sentenced to up to two and a half years imprisonment because they peacefully demonstrated under the slogan 'drug abuse'. Others are threatened with a similar fate.
I endorsed this document because EU forests and other wooded land account for more than 42 of the EU's surface.
There are major imbalances there, too.
The draft regulation extends autonomous trade preferences to Pakistan by suspending for a limited period of time all tariffs for certain products of export interest to Pakistan. A list of 75 dutiable product lines of importance for Pakistan's exports has been established mainly textile and clothing. The selected product lines amount to almost EUR 900 million in import value, accounting for about 27 of EU imports from Pakistan EUR 3.3 billion. I voted 'in favour'.
Let us now consider the question of own resources or maybe another time.
In particular, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get a start in one's career.
I welcome the European Parliament's decision to approve the Commission's proposal to allocate a further EUR 46 million in macro-financial assistance to Georgia.
I voted in favour of this report as I believe that the application of the proposed Action Plan on the Global Navigation Satellite System GNSS will contribute to the establishment of a transport network that is more efficient through safer, more environmentally friendly and more economical modes of transport.
But, because there are lots of Poles in the UK, most of whom are very welcome, we get lots of arrest warrants from Poland.
This is why the Commission has launched actions to support Member States in improving the quality and relevance of education and training from early childhood through to higher education.
The European Union has found itself a new mission.
Madam President, I voted in favour of postponing the final vote because I think there may be some possibility that we can reach agreement with the Council.
Nevertheless, I would congratulate the Court of Auditors on the report it has drawn up relating to the EESC and the developments it achieved during the financial year 2009, and I agree with the rapporteur's conclusions.
Can I now make some specific requests, firstly on the imminent Gaza Flotilla Mark II Can you, Madam Vice-PresidentHigh Representative, put pressure on Turkey to stop this dangerous provocation at a time when Israel is under enormous tension and pressure, with missile attacks from Gaza and the renewed passage of Iranian warships through the Suez Canal And how will the EU engage with a new unitary Palestinian Authority that has Hamas, a terrorist organisation banned by the EU, as one of its components
Particularly important is its concern to ensure that 40 of those taking part in research are women, as this figure is currently no higher than 25.5, and to recognise that 'Europe continues to lag behind the US and is losing the lead it had over the emerging economies'. The report also 'regrets that most of the scientific work carried out within the EU is still done under precarious working conditions'.
On 28 September 2009, the Commission released a communication entitled 'GDP and beyond Measuring progress in a changing world', proposing measures for the creation of a database of EU environmental accounts, with a view to better public debate and better-supported decision making.
There is also the communications side of the whole issue, though, and that side has been abysmal, first of all in Germany, of course, with so many different institutes, authorities and even a number of ministers all giving out different signals.
I voted in favour of this report because its primary aim is to repeal the EU regulation currently in force, laying down additional requirements proving the origin of textile products imported into the EU, thus simplifying the legislation in force and creating a better and clearer legislative environment for businesses.
The current economic and financial crisis gives the EGF a crucial role in mitigating the social impact of the bankruptcy of many companies, often caused by the aggressive economic policies of emerging markets.
Today this focal budget is therefore a very important element among many, because we have once again drawn attention to the fact that it then becomes a driving force for transforming our commitments into reality, which is no small thing.
Overall, our relations have improved over the last two years.
Finally, I would just like to say that we need to follow up on the measures to give small and medium-sized businesses access to China and other markets in Asia.
It is not only the differing views on property and belonging that made Abyei the bone of contention of a civil war that lasted for decades; there are also the differing religions, namely the Muslim North versus the Christian and nature-based religions of the South Sudanese, who were forced together by the haphazard borders drawn up by the former colonial powers.
Mr President, Commissioner, after all these speeches, I wish to thank my fellow Members, the shadow rapporteurs as well as the rapporteurs of the committees who produced opinions, who suggested to me many ideas and who have made it possible to improve the text that we are voting on today.
The failure to conclude this dossier came despite a number of positive steps achieved on the issue of cloning during the last months and hours of negotiations.
We refuse to accept the fact that the tests applied at European level have become a communications exercise by a crisis unit for the nuclear industry, which Mr Sarkozy will showcase at the next G8 in order to sell even more European pressurised water reactors PWRs. That is what we cannot accept, Commissioner.
To create a Single Market, parties must be given the necessary mechanisms that allow their debts to be settled throughout the Union.
Two days ago, on 7 June, talks began in Gaborone between the Southern African Development Community SADC and various players in the country, in order to find a way out of the crisis, which is based on neutrality and consensus, includes all the relevant groups, and can be supported both by the international community and by the broad majority of the citizens of Madagascar.
I welcome the majority of over 80 received in the European Parliament during the vote in favour of adopting the report on the fulfilment of the Schengen acquis by Romania and Bulgaria.
Madam President, we are not simply discussing domestic problems in the European Parliament.
Both parties expect to secure significant benefits from the elimination of tariffs and the liberalisation of trade in services and company formation, and reaffirm their commitment to tariff reductions and further liberalisation of company formation and trade in services.
Nevertheless, trade is European, so the laws have to be European, and this is the path we need to continue along.
We have to continue along this path and ensure that these hearings in Ukraine do not actually become selective or anti-opposition in nature.
It would be unfortunate if the Commission's only means of querying an agreement were to be to take the matter to the European Court of Justice.
Stress tests and energy safety should form a crucial part of our energy dialogue with third countries.
The responses we should bring to the challenges that face us - the economic crisis, the rapid rise of the emerging economies, climate change, turbulent demographic change and so on - can only be effective if we create them collectively, at European level. I am absolutely convinced that we should move in the direction of greater involvement of the European Union.
Commissioner, knowing your attachment to Europe, I believe that you will agree with me that the solutions we are debating today, the way in which we shall manage this crisis, will no doubt be a major chapter in European history.
I voted in favour of granting discharge in respect of the 2009 general budget of the European Railway Agency since, as the report shows, it managed its resources well overall. I also agree on the need to make a number of improvements in the area of auditing the accounts and managing the budget in order to reduce the level of carryovers and cancellations, which is still too high.
Finally, I would like to add that we would be very open to finding a swift solution in the second reading - and we would be very grateful if this were possible - in other words, we would suggest that, rather than following the normal procedure of the second reading, we should try to find a so-called early second-reading agreement.
In order to avoid any misinterpretation or misunderstanding, let me read it out in English 'It is hereby declared that the agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament in the trialogue of 23 May 2011 concerning the directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 199962EC on the charging of heavy goods vehicles for the use of certain infrastructures, Eurovignette, does not prejudge the outcome of interinstitutional negotiations on correlation tables'.
The ratio is 12. I therefore call for our provisions to enable us, at European level, to gain a better understanding of the world of domestic work so that we can guarantee it better.
However, in a world challenged by energy shortages, we need to remain open-minded.
One of the priority goals of European Union policy should be to introduce a transparent, clear, effective and high-quality regulatory environment.
In view of this and the statement by the EP President to the effect that freedom of movement is perhaps the aspect of the EU most appreciated by Europeans, what position does the Commission intend to adopt with regard to Denmark following its recent decision to reintroduce border controls Is it willing to take measures further to strengthen external EU borders Will it review the principle that the Member State of entry bears sole responsibility for illegal immigrants
In preparing their next commitments, Member States will ensure a broader scope, a more concrete approach and a higher degree of ambition.
In the agreement governing the formation of this future government, which will take place in a month perhaps, there was acceptance of the concept of elections, of the Palestinian Authority, of the fact that Mahmoud Abbas could take part in negotiations, and of the concept of the 1967 borders, which are both an essential requirement and an implicit recognition of Israel.
There have been speeches in this debate which would have been perfectly legitimate if they had reflected the views of individuals, but which are totally inadequate when they are delivered on behalf of a committee which I am quite convinced has not felt represented by the words we have heard.
We can only deplore this policy of double standards when it comes to applying social rights.
Schengen cooperation started on 14 June 1985, with the Schengen Agreement, allowing for the abolition of systematic border controls at the internal borders of the signatory states and for the creation of a common area, with free movement of persons.
On this condition, perhaps the aspiration of 3 of GDP to be devoted to RD will become a reality
The impression one gets from this report, or indeed from others on the same subject or on foreign policy, is that the intention is to push the European Union into ensuring that it gradually gains the upper hand over the Member States in drawing up foreign and defence policy.
Following careful examination, the EU committee responsible recognised that these countries have fulfilled all the criteria for membership of the Schengen area they offer sufficient assurances as regards the protection of national borders on land, at sea and in the air and they have mastered the Schengen Information System for data exchange and reliably ensure data protection.
Given the 25 fall in its turnover compared with the pre-crisis period, this sector, an important and well-developed one in our regions, needs our support, not more constraints.
The proliferation of such information makes this more difficult and contributes to decreasing the public's quality of life.
Given that the introduction of the Schengen area has shifted responsibility for EU external border controls onto a limited number of Member States, how will the Commission persuade Member States as a whole to show greater and more effective solidarity in the face of a mass influx of migrants and overcome their manifest reluctance to assume their responsibilities in this respect, so as to ensure that the burden is fairly shared
It gives a very poor impression of our institution. I would inform you that the amount allocated sometimes exceeds the amount actually spent.
We are entering a crucial stage in the EU-India free trade agreement negotiations.
The adoption of this ILO convention can help reduce the numbers of working poor, improve working conditions and facilitate the social inclusion of some of the most vulnerable workers.
This is not demagogy but simple ...
Regarding the ESM, we are now in the process of establishing it. As you know, I hope the governments will very soon agree on that and so I hope that there will be a political decision in the European Council confirming the decisions regarding the European Stability Mechanism and, of course, you know what our position is.
On the one hand, the EU wants to carve out its global role as a diplomatic heavyweight but, on the other hand, the CFSP requires unanimity, which means compromising to preserve the interests of individual Member States, particularly the big ones.
This is why I can assure you that a serious, objective and thorough approach is very important to me.
I voted in favour of this own-initiative report because the increasingly important contribution of the aviation sector brings with it many advantages for the European economy, but also quite a few disadvantages. I believe that the institution to which I belong, namely Parliament, should be given greater supervisory powers so that it has a full understanding of the types of agreement that do or do not deserve its consent.
On 6 May 2009 Parliament carried out a review of its Rules of Procedure and introduced, under Rule 51, a new 'procedure with joint committee meetings', in order to streamline procedures regarding the approval of matters that go beyond the competences of a single committee, so that only one report is submitted to plenary, which would reflect the position of all the committees involved.
If they do not, they should.
Working in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly, I have repeatedly experienced cultural differences and their consequences.
Particularly positive points in the report that has been approved are the proposal for a specific regulation on the prohibiting of building on land cleared by fires proven to have resulted from arson, and the request for suitable funding for forestry strategies, which is currently at a very low level.
This is the old hoary chestnut that is brought forward to object to every proposal.
I voted in favour of postponing the decision on discharge for the 2009 financial year, as the Court of Auditors qualified its opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the accounts for the 2009 financial year.
Therefore, let us first conclude the reform of our internal governance, which is urgently needed and which will be a huge step forward once implemented.
Although some problems remain unresolved, Romania and Bulgaria have proved to be sufficiently prepared to apply all the requirements of the Schengen acquis.
In order to stimulate the economies of the countries in the Western Balkans, they have been given privileged access to the European market.
The export of radioactive waste to third countries must be banned.
Mr President, Commissioner, I beg your pardon. I glanced up at the public gallery for an instant as I have the good fortune that a visiting group from Hungary also happens to be present right now.
Countless factors have a bearing on this growth, which is not unconnected to the deepening of the crisis of capitalism and its social effects in many countries.
Rapid alert, tracking and tracing have all worked.
I voted for discharge of the implementation of the budget of the European Railway Agency for the financial year 2009, because Parliament granted its director discharge in May.
Indeed, it is an open secret in Ukraine and abroad that the real cause of the gas crisis that descended on us in early 2009 was a rift between the family clans of Prime Minister Tymoshenko and President Yushchenko, as they fought to control the profits from the transport of gas. I agree that exploiting the baseless criminalisation of political opponents in order to repress opposition forces is unacceptable, but I find it highly presumptuous to claim that none of Tymoshenko's team put a foot wrong during their chaotic period in government.
We must view this industry from a global perspective, as it is a true worldwide industry with an underlying global capital market.
I would like to repeat what I said in my introduction I remain committed to the principle of maintaining a balance and complementarity between the two pillars of the common agricultural policy. I also intend to keep a strong second pillar in the future common agricultural policy.
In particular, Member States should reform the way they carry out research on security, one of the key areas mentioned in the report, to ensure that it is optimised during times of financial crisis.
When that time comes, we will again ask the Spanish Government to allow official status for Catalan in the EU. The Spanish Government should bring the Catalan language to the EU just as the Irish Government did with the Gaelic language some years ago.
Improved coordination on economic and fiscal policy, particularly within the Eurozone, would be good for Europe's long term economic growth but must be based on the right rules.
This report adds a key element to a European policy that must aim to provide young Europeans with the tools to be more competitive on a labour market that has become increasingly globalised.
The report supporting Romania's inclusion in this area, adopted by the European Parliament, only serves to confirm that the opinions of the Union's experts are correct - Romania has done a good job, made its borders secure and fulfilled all the required conditions.
The constraints currently imposed on the Member States could result in increased restrictions on investment in science, technology and innovation, particularly in the most vulnerable countries.
In speeches such as these, delivered on behalf of the individual committees, it is my belief that the speaker must make an effort to represent the committee on behalf of which he or she is speaking.
At a conference in Tunisia, organised by the Party of European Socialists, attended by representatives of parties and movements from the whole region, we asked the European Union for an emergency programme which will support the democratic processes now, immediately.
The points to be further developed are a stronger focus on prevention of unsustainable fiscal and macroeconomic policies; the need for national reform programmes and stability and convergence programmes to be duly dealt with at national level before submission to EU-level surveillance; a stronger and more independent role for the Commission in the surveillance procedure; more independence for the Commission in relation to the Council concerning compliance with EU rules; the need for the decision-making procedure based on reversed qualified majority voting in the Council to be introduced in both the preventive and the corrective parts of the framework; enhanced transparency and accountability, in order to strengthen peer support and peer pressure; a more independent role for the Commission in the decision-making procedure but also greater accountability on the part of the Commission; and lastly, the need for Parliament to have a stronger role in the surveillance process, but not an executive role.
In 2009, the European Union and Japan accounted for approximately 20 of the world economy and in 2010, bilateral trade was worth EUR 120 billion.
The West has therefore paid dearly for the loyalty of a small and, moreover, diminishing part of the political leadership in Pakistan.
Finally, I should like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Haglund, on his excellent work and dedication.
The Commission has proposed to exempt 50 of the tractors manufactured in the EU in the last five years because of the technological development time lag, which makes it impossible - unless an enormous amount of money is spent - to carry out the mechanical modifications necessary to move on to the next stage, and because of the economic crisis affecting the tractor market, which has seen a 20 annual fall in its turnover since 2008.
In addition to this, the final report failed to acknowledge the amount of money being wasted on Strasbourg.
Madam President, I have taken careful note of the opinions expressed during the course of this debate. I would like to thank honourable Members for their views and assure them once again that the Commission will continue to work with Parliament, Member States and stakeholders from all sectors in pursuit of the common aim of moving forward as fast as possible with both proposals on novel food and cloning.
I will vote based on the rapporteur's suggestion in paragraph 34, with a reservation about mentioning regions falling under these limits. I will also vote in favour of Amendment 5 for clear, strict criteria, which we regard as being of paramount importance in order to avoid difficulties when implementing the new framework.
It also remains unclear how the interplay between the European Semester and the new economic governance infrastructure will function, and I also have concerns about the permanent European Stability Mechanism emerging as an intergovernmental tool.
Although it is expected that South Sudan will apply for accession to the Cotonou Agreement, the 10th European Development Fund will not be available until sometime after accession to the agreement.
The aim of the resolution is to strengthen corporate governance, which is considered by the Commission to be the major element of the programme of financial market reform and crisis prevention. I disagree with that because it may lead to an increase in corruption and violations. I voted 'against'.
We respect the outcome of the referendum on the independence of South Sudan, scheduled to take effect on 9 July 2011, as an expression of the democratic will of the Sudanese people.
In the plenary sitting of 6 April 2011, the President announced, in accordance with Rule 62 of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure, that he had received a letter from the National Anti-Corruption Department Prosecutor's Office of the High Court of Cassation and Justice of Romania on 5 April 2011 requesting the waiver of the parliamentary immunity of Adrian Severin.
That is why I am in favour of the report by my fellow Member, Brian Simpson, on the implementation of a set of criteria for evaluating the content of these agreements. I also think that there is a need to promote balanced market access and investment opportunities, as well as fair competition, particularly with regard to public subsidies and social and environmental standards.
European environmental economic accounts debate 
With regard to the former, we have shown in the overview that we presented and in the ensuing debate that regional and local authorities and civil society are insufficiently involved in the design, implementation and development of regional planning, that is to say in the use of cohesion policy tools.
We must also become better at being able to work and think in an interdisciplinary manner.
Origin marking would facilitate consumer choice and contribute to reducing fraudulent, inaccurate or misleading claims of origin.
With regard to the debt issue, work is under way as part of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative.
In particular, it focuses on developing more comprehensive indicators that would provide a more reliable knowledge base. I would express my support for the Commission's intention to adopt a clearly defined measuring system that would go beyond GDP, in the sense that it complements GDP in the context of decision making and assessment, using clearly defined and quantifiable indicators.
Khartoum's military action in Abyei appears to be jeopardising the good overall outcome of this journey, though not the founding of the 54th African state on 9 July.
My colleague Mr Eickhout has highlighted the numerous benefits to the EU of having more ambitious targets, and moves within this parliament to reduce our ambitions will be rejected by Europe's citizens.
This European harmonisation also ensures that if the protection of workers is at risk when they are using tractors, the Member States can implement the necessary and required measures, bearing in mind compliance with the Treaty and technical regulations on the protection structures specified in this directive.
Evidence of this is, on the one hand, the lacklustre action deriving from its external policy and, on the other, the obstinacy of certain countries that are nostalgic for a colonial period that can no longer return and insist on believing that they protect their interests better by doing things alone and not delegating anything to European authority.
To increase support for these projects, it is crucial to increase communication between those in charge of them and the general public, in order to create a direct relationship between these initiatives and European citizens.
It is easy to go around shouting about how dreadful everything is and focusing solely on the question of the exit from nuclear power, in other words, all or nothing.
It should therefore be ensured that urban areas in all the EU regions, as centres of economic activity, innovation and employment, can benefit from necessary and adequate support in order to address the enormous challenges they are facing, such as the trend towards suburbanisation, the concentration of poverty and unemployment, and rising levels of congestion and pollution, among others.
Eurovignette III will allow Member States - if they so wish - to charge road users for external costs air, noise, pollution, so that finally, the 'polluter pays' principle is introduced in road transport.
Therefore we have been looking for ways in which we can turn to the positive motivation of companies, organisations and lobbies to register. I think we achieved a lot because, with the agreement of Parliament, we are actually turning this system into a mandatory one.
On the other hand, we do recognise that Georgia has financing needs and that there is an EU responsibility here.
This is an important source of generics for developing countries, and we should not bow to pressure from the pharmaceutical industry to make it more difficult for Canada to provide generic medicines.
This agreement has resulted in the creation of 230 crew jobs for the Seychelles population, 2 900 jobs in Seychelles and 760 jobs in various areas of the sector in Europe.
The Commission is pleased with the own-initiative report on promoting worker mobility within the European Union and is following the debate in the parliamentary committees with great interest.
I should like to say something to you as a Portuguese.
In consequence, an EU-negotiated trade agreement is likely to be less beneficial for an individual Member State - and, I have to say, the UK in particular - than if the Member State had been able to negotiate for itself.
They obviously enjoyed all the hard work. I would like to thank this nine-strong team from the bottom of my heart.
The question that was raised by several speakers, the first being Mr Groote and then Mr Hafner, concerned the mandatory register.
Retaining the two-pillar model guarantees that farmers will continue to receive a fixed amount in the future that they can rely on. These payments are important for long-term planning.
On the other hand, I always worry that the large number of bilateral agreements will cause us to lose sight of the overall picture and that we will end up with a patchwork of agreements that makes it hard to achieve a genuine agreement within the framework of the WTO.
Finally, macroregions are very effective, and here I would like to suggest to the Commissioner that, following the example of other strategies, we create a strategy for the Carpathians, one of the largest regions of the European Union and one of the best endowed in terms of natural riches.
Issues relating to remuneration policies, and governance of the remuneration of directors and managers of financial institutions, must be governed by ethical and moral principles that do not allow situations such as those experienced in the recent past, with the awarding of management prizes in companies that immediately afterwards filed for bankruptcy or were found to be in serious difficulties.
In the next framework programme, this situation must change so that we will be able to fulfil the aims of the reformed common fisheries policy.
However, in the UK at least, and we will hear this later, the European Arrest Warrant has become a favourite stick with which the Eurosceptics batter the reputation of the EU. Their cause has been helped by several notorious cases of breaches of human rights.
Its content is nothing new the opening up of markets, and the liberalisation of services, including increasingly commercialised public services at the mercy of multinationals, making it harder for Member States to exercise their social function in these areas.
EU legislation providing for this already exists for footwear, and it makes sense to provide our consumers with the same level of information when they buy their clothes.
Account needs to be taken of the fact that Croatia will accede to the European Union in 2012 or 2013 and that, as a result of its geographical location, it represents a good trans-shipment point for drug dealers.
Applying double standards and talking about mandatory criteria which, once they have been met, are regarded as 'only technical' is not at all characteristic of a democratic, fair Union, as we know it. This is why I can only hope that the opinions of the experts and those of the European legislative will not continue to be ignored by politicians from Member States.
It is a fact that, in Europe, we have too little funding for higher education.
My fellow conservative and liberal Members, some of you want to punish automatically States that are heretics to your dogma to the tune of billions of euros.
It is a crisis, and we all know it is a crisis.
That is why Member States must take all the measures necessary to ensure and maintain a maximum level of security in European power plants and a maximum level of protection for citizens.
Under these circumstances, the Commission's attitude of inertia and its refusal to take the necessary measures - a stance you have confirmed here today, Commissioner - is absolutely disgraceful.
Transitional arrangements for bilateral investment agreements between Member States and third countries debate 
Indeed, transparency is vital to the functioning of the European institutions and it has often been seen as lacking.
The Greens insisted on the promotion of 'cultural cooperation' instead.
Moreover, it calls for a White Paper on forest protection, addressing financial resources, knowledge exchange and promotion of research. 3. There is recognition of the importance of forests for rural development and the need to remove obstacles to funding for forestry and biodiversity. A call for access to funding of the relevant measures for public bodies and rural producers has been agreed upon.
Regrettably, early indications suggest that the Russian leadership has learnt nothing from the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights that there were no grounds for dissolving the Republican Party and apparently does not wish to allow the newly established People's Freedom Party to be registered.
Taking into account these examples and our common experience in the past with the UN Human Rights Commission and, since 2006, with the UN Human Rights Council, we suggest that clear membership criteria should be introduced in the UNHRC, and the EU should stand firmly behind this initiative.
The 32 crimes included only relate to organised crime, unless piglets or ties are being stolen by armed and organised criminal gangs.
The higher absorption rates for environmental programmes under the European territorial cooperation objective show the added value of cross-border and interregional cooperation - which should therefore be encouraged in future.
One final question tax evasion.
This sum must be allocated as a matter of priority to projects put forward by SMEs and industry in general, particularly in the areas of energy provision, sustainable development and the fight against climate change.
It is important to say that when such cuts were made in the past, without taking into account fleets' particularities, the state of fish stocks in each case and each country's consumption needs, they did not solve any of the problems with which the sector is now faced.
For companies within EU countries, there would be gains if we could tackle barriers to public procurement, to the medical devices market - where there is insufficient recognition of international standards, to services - including financial services and postal services, and access for SMEs.
Guillermo Farinas, last year's winner of the Sakharov Human Rights Prize, has accused the Cuban regime and, in particular, the First Secretary of the Communist Party, Raul Castro, of Juan Soto's death.
There has to be an assessment of the shortcomings in all other ways possible, such as providing financial and operational support.
The Northern army has occupied Abyei and 15 000 people have taken flight. I believe that we, the European Union, must help in a very tangible way as we did before and that this must take the form of getting food and humanitarian aid for the refugees moving as soon as possible and preparing the emergency humanitarian aid for the refugees.
We also need to improve the rules on the submission of reports by firms of lobbyists regarding their outlays on lobbying activities.
Unfortunately, we have all seen that it was a failure. I believe that we can retain the hope that during the meeting this weekend, on Saturday, there will still be some positive developments.
Article 8 of the chapter on law and procedure on the immunity of Members of the European Parliament stipulates that the latter shall not be subject to any form of inquiry, detention or legal proceedings in respect of opinions expressed or votes cast by them in the performance of their duties.
It is essential that foreign aid and foreign policy remain the remit of individual Member States and is not dictated at EU level, even if the recipient is in need and appropriate.
In our legal opinion, it now complies in every respect with the requirements of the European EIA Directive.
As such, an agreement is being concluded between Greece, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which share this natural space, so as to establish cooperation on managing the waters of these lakes to prevent, control and reduce their pollution; to protect and conserve the area's biodiversity and protect its soil from erosion; to promote the sensible use of natural resources and sustainable development; to prevent the introduction of alien animal and plant species; and to regulate human activities with a negative impact on the area. I am convinced of the need to increase cooperation between the involved parties, always on the basis of respect for the principle of equality, of territorial integrity and of mutual benefit, so as to protect this area of exceptional value. I am therefore voting for this agreement.
Although there are some positive references to general principles of 'humanising work' and promoting creativity and the need for accessible pathways from informal to formal learning, they are all stale dead letter which simply embellish a report which, in the final analysis, promotes neoliberalism in every procedure and at every stage of education and training, even at the highest level.
Notwithstanding the generally positive judgment on the progress made by these two Member States in terms of security, the report itself admits that numerous technical and administrative shortcomings were detected in the bodies tasked with ensuring the border security of both States and, in particular, in the bodies tasked with checking and monitoring sea and land borders.
We do not agree that the level of payments from the EU budget should be frozen during 2012, which is why we do not support Amendment 16. The payments are based on previous years' budget decisions regarding commitments and therefore the level of the payments is simply a consequence of previous undertakings.
Parliament also particularly wants all meetings between MEPs and interest groups on a particular issue to be mentioned at the end of the reports. I regret that registration is not mandatory, but as the saying goes 'Chi va piano va sano'.
I voted against this report, which draws cultural goods into a logic of the market and competition.
However, the recent past has demonstrated that, no matter the advantages this provides, the system has its drawbacks, too.
So, when the EU raises taxes in the UK, will the people respond by kicking the EU in the ballot box No, because they are not informed.
There is room for optimism, and fortunately so, because the Council, Parliament and the Commission are fully in agreement on this issue and are aware of this need to shift the focus of European research and innovation on to the major social and economic challenges that exist. I am, of course, thinking of climate change - an issue already discussed - but I am also thinking of energy security, the post-Fukushima period, which will have to be managed, and food safety, rocked by the E. Coli bacterium.
The protocol to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement with the Islamic Republic of Mauritania expires on 31 July 2012.
To quote Sakharov Prize winner, Sergei Kovalev, there is no doubt that in modern terminology, these acts were crimes against humanity.
Let us send a strong signal to the European Commission and Europe's agricultural producers, showing our support for a fairer, simpler and more flexible CAP.
Unfortunately, the European Parliament was not involved in the negotiations on the EU-US agreement and so was not able to influence the content of the document.
Member States will then be able to integrate in taxes or tolls levied the actual costs incurred by traffic-based air and noise pollution, whereas up to now, only infrastructure-related costs could be charged.
What is needed is a concerted plan to defend the single currency, to fight off speculation on sovereign debts and to denounce the rating agencies, which are primarily to blame for the crisis we are undergoing.
At this point, I should also mention the impact of the WTO Doha Development Round on an EU-India FTA.
Nonetheless, the European Arrest Warrant must be amended today, as its application is obviously incompatible with the standards we have called for, particularly in terms of the checking of proportionality in individual cases.
Russia is a rising country and a developing country in terms of wealth.
In this regard, what Parliament is proposing in terms of research and innovation - specifically simplifying funding for research, development and innovation RDI, and promoting appropriate programme management, especially for SMEs - is particularly important, as is strengthening innovation capacities over the full cycle, including non-technological innovation within the future financial framework for research and innovation. I also support investment intended to support local SMEs through, for example, the involvement of innovation centres, chambers of commerce, business associations and innovation clusters across the Single Market.
Within the framework of this global plan, particular attention is given to technical and vocational education, which is allocated the role of serving the needs of the cheapest possible, disenfranchised workforce worthy of the 'labour market' and 'competitiveness'. That is why education and training courses must meet both current and future market needs.
This postpones Parliament's decision on granting the Executive Director of the European Medicines Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the 2009 financial year.
Mr President, this will be the first of three contributions that I will make to honourable Members this morning, so I want to start by giving you my vision of the issues that face us and also to try and touch upon some of the detail of the issues that honourable Members have added to this debate, knowing the importance that you attach to them.
This has shaken people's faith in the process.
Child labour and the organised violation of human rights must not be ignored when trade agreements are under discussion and the EU must take a strong position in promoting social policy and labour and social standards in trade negotiations.
Although, undoubtedly, the crisis of the banking system contributed considerably to our current economic problems, it would be a mistake to conceal that most of the problems arose prior to the crisis from a lack of fiscal discipline in numerous countries, from economic policy that did not strengthen competitiveness, and from the absence of coordination in European economic policy.
As has been said, domestic work is often undervalued, or seen as traditional women's work that 'anybody can do', but we have also made the point that a lot of it is actually quite skilled.
If, like Parliament and the Commission, the Council really wants to give Europe a real chance in the context of globalisation, then it needs to understand that spending wisely is far more useful than limiting spending and that joint funding for joint projects is a more intelligent approach than spreading resources thinly between short-lived projects.
This report, which I fully support, does well to highlight the value of agriculture, from both a food and a rural development and land preservation point of view.
Several of the comments on increasing transparency are along the right lines. I also consider it reasonable for Parliament to award prizes, especially for the purpose of supporting European cinema.
We also plan to set up a cybercentre where we could coordinate at European level the efforts that are being made in the different Member States.
It is essential that the Member States adopt political strategies aimed at combating this problem that are based on the objectives set by the Europe 2020 strategy of reducing school drop-out rates to below 10 per year, and of enabling at least 40 of young people to complete higher education.
We now continue with the debate on the report by Salvador Garriga Polledo on a new Multiannual Financial Framework MFF for a competitive, sustainable and inclusive Europe.
Because domestic work takes place largely within the family home, there can be issues of privacy involved.
The Garriga Polledo report assumes a figure of between 75 and 90 for the intermediate category for regional support.
Therefore, the evaluation of the Framework Programme can play a significant role in this respect in other words, by seeking to reduce the obstacles to the European economy's growth that have been emerging, specifically by cutting red tape in procedures for accessing research support programmes.
Instead of being viewed solely as a means of helping people to get better jobs, upskilling must give them the opportunity to shape the jobs of the future and, hence, contribute actively to an innovative economy.
The remaining sums should not be diverted from research and used for other programmes or instruments that do not come within the research and innovation sector or the objectives and scope of FP7.
The responsibility of the regions for implementing European objectives brings added value in itself.
Madam President, I should like to thank the Presidency of Parliament for having allowed this debate to take place, as it was not on the agenda initially.
The report on the 2009 discharge for the European Police College provided for the postponement of the discharge. I voted in favour of this report in order to acknowledge the structural problems that the College has been facing for many years now.
Like the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the Small Business Act Review does not learn the lessons of the Monti report for re-establishing citizens' confidence in the European Union.
In view of this, cooperation with the leading regional powers should be encouraged, so that the EU can actively participate in the building and improvement of an international environment that enables the EU to promote its values and interests, as required by the Treaty.
Despite the logical conclusions that you have outlined today, I am still not clear about the consequences of the forthcoming test.
By approving Mr Klinz's report appealing for effective regulation of rating agencies, Parliament is taking another step towards greater transparency in the financial markets.
I want to congratulate you, the Parliament, those that have been working most on this matter, and also the Hungarian Presidency of the Council, as it has done some very important work as well.
Anyone seeking to freeze the budget will damage Europe and weaken our ability to fulfil our duties to our citizens.
The report provides for a simplified CAP structured around two pillars the first pillar being fully financed by the EU budget and the second pillar providing for multiannual programming and a cofinancing approach.
The results are plain to see instead of the promised convergence, what we have is a visible divergence, exacerbated by the effects of the economic and social crisis, and by the functioning and development of instruments like the Single Market, to the benefit of some and to the clear detriment of others.
I strongly believe that the European Parliament will adopt this report tomorrow and that the Council will act accordingly as soon as possible.
The common agricultural policy is not just a policy for agriculture; it is an instrument for redistributing resources from the towns of Europe to the countryside.
The system can only be complete once the Council - which is the second chamber of our legislature - joins in, but I welcome the tentative steps forward which are being made and I thank the Presidency for its statement this afternoon.
It will also lead to sustainable development and increase the EU's capacity to influence the international order. I therefore urge the continuation of the work already under way to form a united front which will improve relations between Europe and other world powers, promote a more effective response in situations of international crisis, and improve Europe's standing on the world stage.
As far as vocational education and training are concerned, the key factors listed in the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth need to be translated into practical steps at European Union level.
I voted in favour of the report '2009 discharge performance, financial management and control of EU agencies' in order to acknowledge that the functioning of all EU agencies needs to be further improved.
The Commissioner included a number of measures in the White Paper for which this step is necessary.
We also believe that enhanced transparency and accountability are crucial, in order to strengthen peer support and peer pressure, and that Parliament should have a stronger role in the surveillance process, but not an executive role.
The current change in the international order is pushing the European Union to make a more active effort in its dealings with world and emerging powers so that it can take a proactive role in building a United Nations that can make an effective contribution to global solutions peace, security, democracy and an international order based on the rule of law.
It is also true that this is more of a horizontal issue for the Commission, and there are in other EU initiatives very relevant proposals including, for example, the country-specific recommendations which we just published today, very important references to the need to reform education policies and improve the performance of education and training systems in various Member States in order to better connect the substance of education and training with the needs of the labour market.
Mr President, Baroness Ashton, during the course of this debate, you will hear not only praise, but also criticism.
We must listen to what European citizens are saying to us, they who have been the first to suffer the economic and social effects of the crisis austerity alone is intolerable.
We should also be prepared for the eventuality that, just as in Chernobyl, the operator of the plant in Fukushima has made an attempt to conceal the damage and has tried to water down the information relating to these issues.
This report, like those concerning the rules applied to tractors, is aimed at undertaking the codification of Directive 80720EEC of 24 June 1980, which concerns the harmonisation of Member State legislation on the operating space, access to the driving position and the doors and windows of wheeled agricultural or forestry tractors.
The process must be evidence-based, impact-assessed and with full parliamentary involvement, and on that basis, as I have said, the time for talking is over and we need to move forward.
Decisive action must also be taken against the various forms of fraud aimed at consumers. I see this petition as a step in the right direction, which should be followed by further measures, and, therefore, I have voted in favour of it.
It involves a common European Union investment policy in the context of international trade policy with all their concomitant effects on the situation in the EU and the Member States with regard to social, economic and employment policy, weighing up the interests of financial groups, big business and economic enterprises, on the one hand, and those of the trade unions and workers on the other.
If necessary, we will have to investigate whether there will be shortages, to ensure that emissions trading remains an effective instrument for reducing CO2 emissions within the market economy.
This reveals your real partisan bias.
There is an unnatural combination of strains and DNA in the virus.
The debate on future financial perspectives was very heated and the report put together by Mr Garriga Polledo offers an effective summary that encompasses the positions taken by the different national delegations and the various political groups.
The other homework given by the European Council was to increase the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank, and in this regard we were able to come to an agreement with this Parliament, which is another success we achieved, and I believe this was an important step towards the reconciliation of the situation in the countries of North Africa.
The institutions whose activities are audited by Parliament through the Committee on Budgetary Control, of which I am a member, are obliged to cooperate with that committee, for example by providing it with all the documents that are needed to ascertain that public money is being properly used.
Through today's resolution Parliament grants the Director of the European Maritime Safety Agency discharge in respect of the implementation of the Agency's budget for the financial year 2009.
Honourable Members, we are in a situation where the financial industry is slowly recovering from this crisis, an unprecedented struggle - even though, for some banks, the crisis already seems to be over.
It is the European citizens in the countryside who take care of our forests, rivers and lakes and who give us food, clean air and water.
The waiver of Mr Gollnisch's immunity relates to an alleged offence of incitement to racial hatred as a result of a press release issued on 3 October 2008 by the Rhone-Alpes Region Front National Group, of which Mr Gollnisch was president, so these activities were of a purely regional and local nature as a Rhone-Alpes regional councillor, a mandate to which Mr Gollnisch was elected by direct universal suffrage and which is distinct from that of Member of the European Parliament.
2011 is a strategic moment to draw lessons from the four years of operation of Regulation EC No 19052006 establishing a financing instrument for development cooperation DCI. The Commission has announced that it will present its proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework MFF for the post-2013 period before the summer recess and the legislative proposals for the financing instruments for external action later this year.
